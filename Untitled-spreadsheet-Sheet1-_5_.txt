ExECUTIvE PROgRAMME
ECONOMIC, COMMERCIAL &
INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY LAWS
Conceptual understanding and application of
compliance mandates of Economic and
Commercial legislation is vital for professionals
like Company Secretaries specifically from the
perspective of compliance risks and especially
when it involves foreign exchange, foreign
investments, competition law aspects, consumer
rights etc. This study aims to provide conceptual
and application oriented understanding of the
subject.
Further, Company Secretary plays advisory,
compliance and representative roles with respect
to various Economic and Commercial Laws
including Foreign Exchange Management Act,
FDI Policy, Foreign Trade Policy, Competition
Law, Consumer Protection Act, law relating Real
Estate Regulation etc. It is important for a
Company Secretary to be well versed with
Economic and Commercial Laws. It is also vital
for students to have working knowledge of
various Economic and Commercial legislations.
Intellectual Property Rights (IPRs) are private
rights which are applied for, and enforced, by the
owner of the concerned Intellectual Property
(IP). While IPRs are becoming increasingly
important in the global arena, there is a need to
increase awareness on IPRs in India, be it
regarding the IPRs owned by oneself or respect
for others' IPRs. The importance of IPRs as a
marketable financial asset and economic tool
also needs to be recognised. In the Intellectual
Property Rights regime Company Secretary is
also authorized to act as a Trade Marks Agent.
This study material has been prepared to provide
an understanding of certain Economic,
Commercial and Intellectual Property legislations
which have direct bearing on the functioning of
companies. The study material has been divided
into two parts consisting of twenty study lessons.
Part I dealing with Economic and Commercial
Laws consists of Study Lessons I to XIV,
whereas Part II dealing with Intellectual Property
Laws consists of Study Lesson XV to XX.
This study material has been published to aid the
students in preparing for the Economic,
Commercial & Intellectual Property Laws paper
of the CS Executive Programme under ICSI
Syllabus 2022. It has been prepared to provide
understanding of the Economic, Commercial &
Intellectual Property laws thereunder, which
have a bearing on the conduct of corporate
affairs. It is part of the educational kit and takes
the students step by step through each phase of
preparation stressing key concepts, principle,
pointers and procedures.
The legislative changes made upto December,
2022 have been incorporated in the study
material. The students are advised to refer to the
updations at the Regulator's website,
Supplement relevant for the subject issued by
ICSI and ICSI Journal Chartered Secretary and
other publications. Specifically, students are

LESSON WISE SUMMARY
ECONOMIC, COMMERCIAL & INTELLECTUAL
PROPERTY LAWS
PART I: ECONOMIC & COMMERCIAL LAWS
Lesson 1 - Law relating to Foreign Exchange
Management
The Foreign Exchange Management Act, 1999
(FEMA) is an Act of the Parliament of India to
consolidate and amend the law relating to
foreign exchange with the objective of facilitating
external trade and payments and for promoting
the orderly development and maintenance of
foreign exchange market in India. The Act
extends to the whole of India and it also applies
to all branches, offices and agencies outside
India owned or controlled by a person resident in
India and also to any contravention thereunder
committed outside India by any person to whom
this Act applies. The management of foreign
exchange is very important in the present day
business. FEMA is a regulatory mechanism that
enables the Reserve Bank of India to pass
regulations and the Central Government to pass
rules relating to foreign exchange in tune with
the Foreign Trade policy of India. The Act is
more transparent in its application as it lays
down the areas requiring specific permissions of
the Reserve Bank/ Government of India on
acquisition/holding of foreign exchange. It
stipulate the strict compliances in case of import,
export, debt funding, equity capital infusion,
transfer of shares etc.
It is expected that, at the end of this lesson,
students will, inter alia, be in a position to
understand the:                                     ?            Concept of FEMA;
                                                                                                   Provisions of
                                                                 Concept of                        Realization,                       Rules and
                                                                 Current Account                   Repatriation       Structure       Regulations

Lesson 2 - Foreign Direct Investments -
Regulations & Policy
Foreign Direct Investment (FDI) is a major
source of non-debt financial resource for the
economic development of India. Foreign
companies invest in India to take advantage of
relatively lower wages, special investment
privileges such as tax exemptions, etc. To
promote Foreign Direct Investment (FDI), the
Government has put in place an investor friendly
policy, wherein except for a small negative list,
most sectors are open for 100% FDI under the
Automatic route.
The objective of the lesson is to familiarize the
students with:
* Eligible Investors under FDI;
                                                                                                   Non-debt
* Entry Routes for Investment i.e. Automatic                                                       Instruments

etc;                                         ?                   Permitted Sectors;?               Regulations;
                                                                                                   Reporting of
                                                                                                   FDI i.e.
                                                                                                   reporting of
                                                                                                   Inflow/Issue of
                                                                                                   shares/Transfer
                                                                 Modes of                          of shares etc.
                                                                 Payment allowed                   and filing of
                                                                 for receiving FDI                 FCGPR form
* Conditions of FDI in major sector i.e. E-                      in an Indian                      and other
commence activity, Insurance etc.;                ?              Company;          ?               returns.
Lesson 3 - Overseas Direct Investments (ODI)
Overseas Investment means financial
commitment and Overseas Portfolio Investment
by a person resident in India. Overseas
investments by persons resident in India
enhance the scale and scope of business
operations of Indian entrepreneurs by providing
global opportunities for growth. Such ventures
through easier access to technology, research
and development, a wider global market and
reduced cost of capital along with other benefits
increase the competitiveness of Indian entities
and boost their brand value. These overseas
investments are also important drivers of foreign
trade and technology transfer thus boosting
domestic employment, investment and growth
through such inter-linkages. In view of the
evolving needs of businesses in India, in an
increasingly integrated global market, there is
need of Indian corporates to be part of global
value chain and in keeping with the spirit of
liberalization and to promote ease of doing
business, the Central Government and the
Reserve Bank of India have been progressively
simplifying the procedures and rationalizing the
rules and regulations under the Foreign
Exchange Management Act, 1999. In this
direction, a significant step has been taken with
operationalization of a new Overseas Investment
regime. Foreign Exchange Management
(Overseas Investment) Rules, 2022 have been
notified by the Central Government on August
22, 2022.

The purpose of the lesson is to familiarize the
students with:
                                                                                    ? Setting up of
                                                                  ? Foreign         Subsidiary/Joint
                                                                  currency          Venture/Branch ? Filing of

Lesson 4 - External Commercial borrowings
(ECb)
External Commercial Borrowings are commercial
loans raised by eligible resident entities from
recognized non- resident entities and should
conform to parameters such as minimum
maturity, permitted and non- permitted end-uses,
maximum all-in-cost ceiling, etc. Transactions on
account of External Commercial Borrowings
(ECB) are governed by clause (d) of sub-section
3 of section 6 of the Foreign Exchange
Management Act, 1999 (FEMA). However, ECB

                                                     equity etc.
Lesson 5 - Foreign Trade Policy & Procedure
The Foreign Trade Policy as notified by Central
Government seeks to provide a stable and
sustainable policy environment for foreign trade
in merchandise and services. India's Foreign
Trade Policy (FTP) has, conventionally, been
formulated for five years at a time and reviewed
annually. The focus of the FTP has been to
provide a framework of rules and procedures for
exports and imports and a set of incentives for
promoting exports.
The objective of the lesson is to facilitate the
students to acquaint with:
                                                                   Importer-Exporter

appear before Board of Approval constituted
under Section 8 of the Act.
The purpose of this lesson is to provide the
students with:
                                                                                                                              Special
                                                                   Establishment of       Approval and                        Economic

Lesson 7 - Law relating to Foreign Contribution
Regulation
Foreign Contribution (Regulation) Act, 2010
regulate the acceptance and utilisation of foreign
contribution or foreign hospitality by certain
individuals or associations or companies and to
prohibit acceptance and utilisation of foreign
contribution or foreign hospitality for any
activities detrimental to the national interest and
for matters connected therewith or incidental
thereto. The Act mandates that every bank or
authorized person in foreign exchange shall
report to specified authority, the prescribed
amount of foreign remittance, source and
manner in which foreign remittance was received
and other particulars.
It is expected that, at the end of this lesson,
students will, inter alia, be in a position to
understand the:
* Regulation of foreign contribution, foreign                      Eligible contributor
Source and foreign hospitality;                       ?            & eligible receiver;

Assets; and                                           ?            Penalities.
Lesson 8 - Prevention of Money Laundering
The possible social and political costs of money
laundering, if left unchecked or dealt with
ineffectively, are serious. Organized crime can
infiltrate financial institutions, acquire control of
large sectors of the economy through
investment, or offer bribes to public officials and
indeed governments. The economic and political
influence of criminal organizations can weaken
the social fabric, collective ethical standards, and
ultimately the democratic institutions of society.
In countries transitioning to democratic systems,
this criminal influence can undermine the
transition. Most fundamentally, money
laundering is inextricably linked to the underlying
criminal activity that generated it. Laundering
enables criminal activity to continue.
The Prevention of Money-laundering Act, 2002
enacted to prevent money laundering and to
provide for confiscation of property derived from,
or involved in, money laundering and for matters
connected therewith or incidental thereto.
The objective of the lesson is to introduce the
students regarding:
                                                                                          Offence of
                                                                                          money              Attachment,
                                                                   Process and            laundering and     adjudication

Institutions and Intermediaries;                     ?             Directorate; and ?     KYC and FIU.
Lesson 9 - Laws relating to Fugitive Economic
Offenders
There have been several instances of economic
offenders fleeing the jurisdiction of Indian courts
anticipating the commencement of criminal
proceedings or sometimes during the pendency
of such proceedings. The absence of such
offenders from Indian courts has several
deleterious consequences, such as, it obstructs
investigation in criminal cases, it wastes
precious time of courts and it undermines the
rule of law in India. Further, most of such cases
of economic offences involve non-repayment of
bank loans thereby worsening the financial
health of the banking sector in India. The
existing civil and criminal provisions in law are
inadequate to deal with the severity of the
problem. In order to address the said problem
and lay down measures to deter economic
offenders from evading the process of Indian law
by remaining outside the jurisdiction of Indian
courts, Parliament enacted a legislation, namely,
the Fugitive Economic Offenders Act, 2018 to
ensure that fugitive economic offenders return to
India to face the action in accordance with law.
It is expected that, at the end of this lesson,
students will, inter alia, be in a position to
understand the:
                                                            Procedure for                            Powers of        Power of
                                                            declaration of                           Director and     survey,
                                                            fugitive economic     Attachment of      other            search and

Parliament enacted the Real Estate (Regulation
and Development) Act, 2016 which aims at
protecting the rights and interests of consumers
and promotion of uniformity and standardization
of business practices and transactions in the real

of consumers and promoters by imposing certain
responsibilities on both. It seeks to establish
symmetry of information between the promoter
and purchaser, transparency of contractual
conditions, set minimum standards of
accountability and a fast- track dispute resolution
mechanism.

PART II- INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY LAWS
Lesson 15 - Intellectual Property Rights
Intellectual property is a vital component of
economic growth and a tool for corporate
competitiveness in today's highly competitive
global market. Intellectual property rights serve
as a catalyst for the development of innovations
and inventions. Ideas, innovations, and creative
expressions on the basis of which there is a
public desire to grant the status of property are
referred to as intellectual property rights (IPR). In
order for the inventors or developers of that
property to profit commercially from their creative
efforts or reputation, IPR grant them specific
exclusive rights. There are various forms of
intellectual property protection, including
trademark, copyright, and patent.
The objective of this lesson is to acclimatize

* The basics of Intellectual Property Rights, their international
purpose, need, scope, regulatory framework;         conventions;
* India's National Intellectual Property Rights
Policy, its coverage and goals.
Lesson 16 - Law relating to Patents
With increase in the technological progress of
India, the patents are given to promote
innovations & developments and to ensure that
these creations got recognition commercially
without delay; and patents are conceded to
empower patentee to commercially utilize the
monopoly for the importation of the patented
product into the nation. Patent is a monopoly
grant and it enables the inventor to control the
output and within the limits set by demand, the
price of the patented products. A Patent is a
statutory right for an invention granted for a
limited period of time to the patentee by the
Government, in exchange of full disclosure of his
invention for excluding others, from making,
using, selling, importing the patented product or
process for producing that product for those
purposes without his consent.
The objective of this lesson is to facilitate the
students to get acquainted with:
* Concept of Patents, its infringement, duration,
inventions, what does not fall under purview of
inventions etc.;
* Patent Cooperation Treaty;
* Practical aspects relating to the process of
registration, termination, revocation, withdrawal
of patent application.
Lesson 17 - Law relating to Trade Marks
In view of developments in trading and
commercial practices, increasing globalisation of
trade and industry, the need to encourage
investment flows and transfer of technology,
need for simplification and harmonization of
trade mark management systems and to give
effect to important judicial decisions, a new
Trade Marks Act, 1999 have been enacted. It
aims to provide for registration of trade mark for
goods as well as services including prohibition to
the registration of imitation of well-known
trademarks, and expansion of grounds for
refusal of registration. A Trade Mark
distinguishes the goods of one manufacturer or
trader from similar goods of others and therefore,
it seeks to protect the interest of the consumer
as well as the trader.
The objective of this lesson is to familiarize
students with:
                                                                  Key concepts                                                 Law

Lesson 18 - Law relating to Copyright
In view of technological advancements in recent
times, copyright protection has been expanded
considerably. Copyright is a well-recognised form
of property right which had its roots in the
common law system and subsequently came to
be governed by the national laws in each
country. Today, copyright law has extended
protection not only to literary, dramatic, musical
and artistic works but also sound recordings,
films, broadcasts, cable programmes and
typographical arrangements of publications.
Computer programs have also been brought
within the purview of copyright law. The
copyright law deals with the particular forms of
creativity, concerned primarily with mass
communication. It is also concerned with virtually
all forms and methods of public communication,
not only printed publications but also with such
matters as sound, and television broadcasting,
films for public exhibition etc. and even
computerised systems for the storage and
retrieval of information.
The purpose of this lesson is to help students
understand the:
* Key concepts such as Copyright, Adaptations,
Author, what all is covered under copyright law,
works in which copyright subsists;
                                                                  Copyright, its
                                                                  meaning, term,
                                                                  assignment,
                                                                  infringement,
                                                                  registration
* The object, purpose, need and scope of                          process and its
copyright law in India;                             ?             licensing.
Lesson 19 - Law relating to geographical
Indications of goods
Every region has its claim to fame. Each fame
and reputation was carefully built up and
painstakingly maintained by the masters of that
region, combining the best of nature, man and
traditionally handed over from one generation to
the next for centuries. Gradually, a specific link
between the goods and place of production
evolved resulting in growth of geographical
indications. Geographical Indications of Goods
are that aspect of industrial property which refers
to a country or to a place situated therein as
being the country or place of origin of that
product. These identifications became so
important that these regions started specializing
in producing these unique products. Rising
demand for such products among the
consumers, gave rise for counterfeit products,
which began to tarnish the image of genuine
products. A effort to safeguard the interest of the
producers and consumers led to evolution and
conceptualization of "Geographical Indications".
The objective of this lesson is to familiarize
students with:
                                                      ? Regulatory
                                                      framework
                                                      governing the
                                                      Law of
                                                      Geographical
                                                      Indications of
                                                      Goods in
                                                      India and
                                                      important
* Key concepts such as Geographical                   concepts
Indications, duration, infringement of the same       related
among others;                                         thereto;
* Practical aspects relating to Step by Step
Guide on Geographical Indication of Goods
Registration Process in India.
Lesson 20 - Law relating to Designs
Design is one of the categories of IPR where the
design system focuses on the aesthetic feature
of an article derived from its visual appearance.
Relevant aspects are the shape, configuration,
surface pattern, the colour or line or a
combination thereof as applied to an article
which produces an aesthetic impression on the
sense of sight. The objective of the Designs Act,
2000 is to protect new or original designs so
created to be applied or applicable to particular
article to be manufactured by Industrial Process
or means. Sometimes purchase of articles for
use is influenced not only by their practical
efficiency but also by their appearance. The
important purpose of design registration is to see
that the artisan, creator, originator of a design
having aesthetic look is not deprived of his
bonafide reward by others applying it to their
goods.
The purpose of this lesson is to help students
understand the:
* Concept of Design, its duration, infringement
and publication;
                                                                       Practical aspects
                                                                       relating to Step by
* Regulatory framework governing the Law of                            Step Guide on
Design in India and important concepts related                         registration of
thereto;                                              ?                design in India.

Lesson 1: Law relating Foreign Exchange
Manage
INTRODUCTION
* The Foreign Exchange Regulation Act, 1973
was reviewed in 1993 and several amendments
were enacted as part of the on-going process of
economic liberalisation relating to foreign
investments and foreign trade for closer
interaction with the world economy. At that
stage, the Central Government decided that a
further review of the Foreign Exchange
Regulation Act would be undertaken in the light
of subsequent developments and experience in
relation to foreign trade and investment.
* It was subsequently felt that a better course
would be to repeal the existing Foreign
Exchange Regulation Act and enact a new

continue to decide
* whether a contravention is technical and/or
minor in nature and, as such, can be dealt with
by way of an administrative/ cautionary advice;
* whether it is material and, hence, is required to
be compounded for which the necessary
compounding procedure has to be followed or

serious in nature and, therefore, need to be
referred to the Directorate of Enforcement
(DOE).
However, once a compounding application is
filed by the concerned entity suo moto, admitting
the contravention, the same will not be
considered as 'technical' or 'minor' in nature and
the compounding process shall be initiated.

information, record or any other documents
relevant to the compounding proceedings. In
case the contravener fails to submit the
additional information/documents called for
within the specified period, the application for
compounding will be liable for rejection.
• The following factors, which are only indicative,
may be taken into consideration for the purpose
of passing compounding order and adjudging the
quantum of sum on payment of which
contravention shall be compounded:
* the amount of gain of unfair advantage,
wherever quantifiable, made as a result of the
contravention;
* the amount of loss caused to any authority/
agency/ exchequer as a result of the

order of compounding after affording an
opportunity of being heard to all the concerned
as expeditiously as possible as and not later

LESSON 5 FOREIGN TRADE POLICY AND
PROCEDURE
India's Foreign Trade Policy (FTP) has,
conventionally, been formulated for five years at
a time and reviewed annually. The focus of the
FTP has been to provide a framework of rules
and procedures for exports and imports and a
set of incentives for promoting exports. The FTP
for 2015-2020 seeks to achieve the following
objectives:
1. To provide a stable and sustainable policy
environment for foreign trade in merchandise
and services;

exports and imports with other initiatives such as
"Make in India", "Digital India" and "Skills India"
to create an "Export Promotion Mission? for
India;
3. To promote the diversification of India's export
basket by helping various sectors of the Indian
economy to gain global competitiveness with a
view to promoting exports;
4. To create an architecture for India's global
trade engagement with a view to expanding its
markets and better integrating with major
regions, thereby increasing the demand for
India's products and contributing to the
government's flagship "Make in India" initiative;

LESSON 8: PREVENTION OF MONEY
LAUNDERING ACT


Introduction

* The purpose and object of the Act is prevention
of money laundering, which simply means
conversion of tainted (black) money into
untainted(white) money.
* Money laundering is the processing of criminal
proceeds to disguise its illegal origin.
* Terrorism, illegal arms sales, financial crimes,
smuggling and the activities of organized crime,
including drug trafficking and prostitution rings,
generate huge sums. Embezzlement insider
trading, bribery and computer fraud also produce
large profits and create an incentive to legitimize
the ill-gotten gains through money laundering.

Process of Money Laundering
Money is Laundered in following three stages :
Placement:
Here, the launderer introduces his illegal profits
into the financial system by breaking up large
sums of money into smaller sums.
Layering:
Here, the launderer engages in a series of
conversions or movements of funds to distance
them from their source.
Integration:
Here, the Launderer integrates the smaller
amounts into larger sums and enters the
legitimate economy by investing into real estate,
business ventures, film industry etc.

What influence does money laundering have on
economic development?
Launderers are continuously looking for new
routes for laundering their funds.
Economies with growing or developing financial
centres, but inadequate controls are particularly
vulnerable as established financial centre
countries implement comprehensive anti-money
laundering regimes. Differences between
national anti-money laundering systems will be
exploited by launderers, who tend to move their
networks to countries and financial systems with
weak or ineffective countermeasures. But
postponing action is dangerous. The more it is
deferred, the more organised crime will increase.
As with the damaged integrity of an individual
financial institution, there is a damping effect on
foreign direct. Fighting money laundering and
terrorist financing is therefore a part of creating a
business friendly environment which is a
precondition for lasting economic development.
Impact of Money Laundering
Money laundering process may create the
following impact on the society

* Widespread use of bribery in government
offices leading to corruption.
* Control over vast sector of economy by handful
of people through investment by unfair means
* Infiltration of banking and financial institutions
through organized crimes.
* Dampen social fabric and ethical standards
prevalent in the society.
* Weakens the democratic institution

Global initiatives in the prevention of money
laundering
1. Fiancial Action Task Force (FATF)
FATF was established in 1989. It is an
international body which promotes measures
taken up to counteract the world wide impact of
money laundering Main tasks/functions of FATF
are:
* Review the techniques adopted for money
laundering
* Checks the initiatives made by the countries to
counteract money laundering ? Spread
awareness among non-member countries also
Thus, FATF study, examine and evaluate the
current situation, defines the policy and initiatives
measures that can act as solution to the problem
of money laundering.

2. Prevention of Money Laundering Act, 2002
To counteract the harms caused by money
laundering and with a view to prevent the same,
Prevention of Money Laundering Act, 2002 was
enacted. This Act provides for offences,
punishments in lieu of money laundering,
confiscation attachment and other adjudication
provisions so as to ensure effective prevention of
money laundering.

3. The Vienna Convention
The first major initiative in the prevention of
money laundering was the United Nations
Convention against Illicit Traffic in Narcotic
Drugs and Psychotropic Substances in
December 1988 (popularly known as Vienna
Convention). This convention laid the
groundwork for efforts to combat money
laundering by obliging the member states to
criminalize the laundering of money from drug
trafficking.
It promotes international cooperation in
investigations and makes extradition between
member states applicable to money laundering.
The convention also establishes the principle
that domestic bank secrecy provisions should
not interfere with international criminal
investigations.

4. Council of Europe Convention
The Council of Europe Convention on
Laundering, Search, Seizure and Confiscation of
Proceeds of Crime, 1990 establishes a common
policy on money laundering. The Convention
lays down the principles for international
cooperation among the member states, which
may also include states outside the Council of
Europe. This convention came into force in
September 1993. One of the purposes of the
convention is to facilitate :
* International cooperation as regards
investigative assistance,
* Search, seizure and confiscation of the
proceeds of all types of criminality,
* Particularly serious crimes, such as, drug
offences, arms dealing, terrorist offences etc.
and other offences which generate large profits.


5. European Union Money Laundering Directive
In response to the new opportunities for money
laundering opened up by the liberalization of
capital movements and cross-border financial
services in the European Union, the Council of
the European Communities in June, 1991 issued
a directive on the Prevention of Use of the
Financial System for the Purpose of Money
Laundering. The directive requires member
states to outlaw money laundering. The member
states have been put under obligation to require
financial institutions to establish and maintain
internal systems to prevent laundering, to obtain
the identification of customers with whom they
enter into transaction of more than a particular
amount and to keep proper records for at least
five years. The financial institutions are also
required to report suspicious transactions and
ensure that such reporting does not result in
liability for the institution or its employees.

6. Basle Committee's Statement of Principles
In December 1988 the Basle Committee on
Banking Regulation Supervisory Practices
issued a statement of principles to be complied
by the international banks of member states.
These principles include identifying customers,
avoiding suspicious transactions, and
cooperating with law enforcement agencies.
The statement aims at encouraging the banking
sector to adopt common position in order to
ensure that banks are not used to hide or
launder funds acquired through criminal
activities.

Where the Director or any officer not below the
rank of Deputy Director authorized by him, has
reason to believe on the basis of material in his
possession that any person is in possession of
any proceeds of money laundering, such person
has been charged of having committed a
scheduled offence and such proceeds of crime
are likely to be concealed, transferred or dealt
with in any manner which may result in
frustrating any proceedings relating to
confiscation of such proceeds of crime, such
officer may by order in writing, provisionally
attach such property for a period not exceeding
180 days from the date of the order, in the
manner provided in the Second Schedule of the
Income Tax Act,1961.

interested in the property attached or seized is of
the opinion that any encumbrances on the
property or lease hold interest has been created
with a view to defeat the provisions of the Act, it
may, by order declare such encumbrance or
lease hold interest to be void and thereupon the
property shall vest in the Central Government
free from such encumbrances or lease hold.

person from any liability in respect of such
encumbrances which may be enforced against
such person for a suit of damages.

* The origin of this Directorate goes back to 1st
May, 1956, when an 'Enforcement Unit' was
formed in the Department of Economic Affairs
for handling Exchange Control Laws violations
under Foreign Exchange Regulation Act (FERA),
1947.
* It was headquartered in Delhi, headed by a
Legal Service Officer as the Director of
Enforcement.
* It had two branches - at Bombay and Calcutta.
* In the year 1957, this Unit was renamed as
'Enforcement Directorate', and another branch
was opened at Madras (now Chennai).
* In 1960, the administrative control of the
Directorate was transferred from the Department
of Economic Affairs to the Department of
Revenue.
* With the passage of time, FERA 1947 was
repealed and replaced by FERA, 1973.
* With the onset of the process of economic
liberalisation, FERA, 1973, which was a
regulatory law, was repealed and in its place, a
new law viz. the Foreign Exchange Management
Act, 1999 (FEMA) came into operation w.e.f. 1st
June 2000.
* Further, in tune with the International Anti
Money Laundering regime, the Prevention of
Money Laundering Act, 2002 (PMLA) was
enacted and ED was entrusted with its
enforcement w.e.f. 1st July 2005.


Structure of ED?
* Hierarchy: The Directorate of Enforcement,
with its headquarters at New Delhi, is headed by
the Director of Enforcement.
o There                                          are five        regional   offices   at   Mumbai,   Chennai,   Chandigarh,
Kolkata and Delhi headed by Special Directors of
Enforcement.
o The Directorate has 10 Zonal offices each of
which is headed by a Deputy Director and 11
sub Zonal Offices each of which is headed by an
Assistant Director.
                                                 It comprises
                                                 officers of IRS

done directly and by drawing officers from other Income Tax
investigation agencies. o                        officer,
Excise officer, Customs officer, and police

How ED Functions under PMLA?
* The ED carries out search (property) and
seizure (money/documents) after it has decided
that the money has been laundered, under
Section 16 (power of survey) and Section 17
(search and seizure) of the PMLA. o On the
basis of that, the authorities decide if arrest is
needed as per Section 19 (power of arrest).
* Under Section 50 of the PMLA, the ED can
also directly carry out search and seizure without
calling the person for questioning.
o It is not necessary to summon the person first
and then start with the search and seizure.
* If the person is arrested, the ED gets 60 days
to file the prosecution complaint (chargesheet)
as the punishment under PMLA doesn't go
beyond seven years.
o If no one is arrested and only the property is
attached, then the prosecution complaint along
with attachment order is to be submitted before
the adjudicating authority within 60 days.

RBI Master Direction - Know Your Customer
(KYC) Direction
The objective of Know Your Customer (KYC)
Norms/Anti-Money Laundering (AML)
Measures/Combating of Financing of Terrorism
(CFT) guidelines is to prevent banks from being
used, intentionally or unintentionally, by criminal
elements for money laundering or terrorist
financing activities.
KYC procedures also enable banks to
know/understand their customers and their
financial dealings better which in turn help them
manage their risks prudently.
Regulated Entities (REs) are required to follow
certain customer identification procedures while

What is competition in the market?
Term 'competition' is not defined under the
Competition Act
a situation in a market in which firms or sellers
independently strive for the buyers' patronage in
order to achieve a particular business objective,
for example, profits, sales or market share.. -The

Application for Registration of real estate
projects
Every promoter shall make an application to the
Authority for registration of the real estate project
in such form, manner, within such time and
accompanied by such fee as may be specified
by the regulations made by the Authority.

Granting of Registration by the Authority
On receipt of the application, the Authority shall
within 30 days-
a) Grant registration subject to the provisions of
the Act and the rules and regulations made
thereunder. A registration number, including a
Login Id and password to the applicant for
accessing the website of the Authority and to
create his web page and to fill therein the details
of the proposed project; or
b) Reject the application for reasons to be
recorded in writing, if such application does not
conform to the provisions of this Act or the rules
or regulations made thereunder. Application shall
not be rejected unless the applicant has been
given an opportunity of being heard in the
matter.
If the Authority fails to grant the registration or
reject the application, as the case may be, the
project shall be deemed to have been registered,
and the Authority shall within 7 days of the expiry
of the said period of 30 days specified.
The registration granted shall be valid for a
period declared by the promoter for completion
of the project or phase thereof, as the case may
be.
Extension of registration
Delay in handing over of projects by the
developer within the stipulated time frame has
been a major woe (problem) of the buyers and
hence has been a major trigger for promulgation
of this Act. Hence, at the time of registration, a
developer has to specify a time line during which
he will complete and handover the project to the
buyer.
The timeline is very sacrosanct (important)
because if he fails to do so within the stated
time, then there are rigorous provisions in the
Act as prescribed in section 7 & 8 whereby his
registration would be revoked and his project
would be usurped by the Regulator.
Though as per section 6, an extension of
registration may be granted at the sole discretion
of the regulator due to Force Majeure conditions
or if there are reasonable circumstances which
merit extension.
The registration granted may be extended by the
Authority on an application made by the
promoter due to force majeure, in such form and
on payment of such fee as may be specified by
regulations made by the Authority.
Force majeure" shall mean a case of war, flood,
drought, fire, cyclone, earthquake or any other
calamity caused by nature affecting the regular
development of the real estate project.
Revocation of registration
The Authority may, on receipt of a complaint or
suo-moto in this behalf or on the
recommendation of the competent authority,
revoke the registration granted, after being
satisfied that
a) the promoter makes default in doing anything
required by or under this Act or the rules or the
regulations made there under;
b) the promoter violates any of the terms or
conditions of the approval given by the
competent authority;
c) the promoter is involved in any kind of unfair
practice or irregularities.
The registration granted to the promoter shall not
be revoked unless the Authority has given to the
promoter not less than 30 , in writing, stating the
grounds on which it is proposed to revoke the
registration, and has considered any cause
shown by the promoter within the period of that
notice against the proposed revocation.
The Authority, upon the revocation of the
registration-
Debar the promoter from accessing its website in
relation to that project and specify his name in
the list of defaulters and display his photograph
on its website and also inform the other Real
Estate Regulatory Authority in other States and
Union territories about such revocation or
registration;

other terms and conditions specified under this
Act or any rules or regulations made there under,
or where the Authority is satisfied that such
registration has been secured by the real estate
agent through misrepresentation or fraud, the

Lesson 15: Intellectual Property Rights
Introduction
• Any original work of the human intellect,
including works of art, literature, technology, and
science, is considered to be a work of intellectual
property (IP)
• It is the result of persons Intellectual Activities.
Thus Intellectual Property refers to creation of
mind such as inventions, designs for industrial
articles, literary, artistic work, symbols which are
ultimately used in commerce.
• The legal privileges granted to the inventor or
creator to safeguard his invention or creativity for
a predetermined amount of time are known as
intellectual property rights
(IPR)
• Intellectual Property rights allow the creators or
owners to have the benefits from their works
when these are exploited commercially.

Nature of Intellectual Property
• Intangible Rights over Tangible Property: IP's
intangibility is the primary characteristic that sets
it apart from other types of property. When works
are exploited for commercial purposes, it
enables the creators or owners to profit from their
creations.
• Right to sue: IP is a resource that can be
owned and managed, to use the language of the
law. Since intellectual property (IP) is a property
right, it can be inherited, purchased, gifted, sold,
licenced, entrusted, or pledged. Subject to
certain restrictions, the owner of an IPR owns a
sort of property that can be used however they
like. They also have the legal right to sue anyone
who uses their innovation without their
permission and to be compensated with actual
property.
• Rights and Duties: IP results in both obligations
and property rights. The owner of the IP is
entitled to carry out specific tasks in connection
with his creations. He has the sole authority to
create, copy, sell, and otherwise exploit the
work. Additionally, there is a negative right that
bars others from using their statutory rights.
• Coexistence of different rights: Various IPR
kinds may coexist. For instance, an image of an
innovation might be copyrighted and the
invention itself might be patented.
• Exhaustion of rights: Exhaustion fundamentally
means that after the first sale made by the right
holder or by the authority designated for its
exhaustion, that person's right expires and he is
no longer permitted to halt the movement of the
goods moving forward. As a result, once an IP
rights holder has sold a physical good that bears
IPRs, it cannot stop subsequent sales of the
good. The first consent marks the end of the
right. It is prohibited to use the exclusive selling
privilege in connection to the same items twice.
• Dynamism: IPR is undergoing continual
improvement. New things are being added to the
IPR scope and the scope of its protection is
being enlarged in accordance with the demands
of scientific and technical advancement.
Eg: Biopatents, Software Copyrights, Plant
Diversity Protection

Need of Intellectual Property
• Every invention involves labour, time, and
resources.

• The length of each project varies substantially.
It could be anything from a few seconds to a few
years.
• A certain amount of actual money is also
necessary for any creative endeavour, along
with education or knowledge of course.
• Any creative professional making all of these
investments is making a significant one.
Therefore, it is important to acknowledge and
honour a creator's intellectual works.
• The word "intellectual property" did not become
common usage until the 19th century, despite
the fact that many of the legal rules governing
intellectual property rights have developed over
centuries.
• It wasn't until the latter half of the 20th century
that it spread throughout much of the world. In
1967, the World Intellectual Property
Organization (WIPO) was founded as a UN
body. Since then, the phrase has gained
significant traction in the US.
• A comprehensive international system for
defining, safeguarding, and upholding intellectual
property rights exists. It consists of multilateral
treaty systems as well as international
organisations like the European Union, World
Trade Organization, World Intellectual Property
Organization, World Customs Organization, and
United Nations
Commission on International Trade Law
(UNCITRAL).

                                                        GATS is a set
                                                        of rules that
                                                        govern global
The General Agreement on Trade in Services              trade in
(GATS) •                                                services.
• It was created in 1995 after the Uruguay Round
of talks.
• GATS is like a sibling to the General
Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT), which
deals with goods.
• The main goals of GATS are to have fair and
reliable trade rules, treat everyone equally, and
promote economic growth.
• GATS has three levels of rules: basic
principles, sector-specific rules, and
commitments made by individual countries to
allow access to their markets.
• Services are essential for the economy, even
though they represent a smaller share of total
trade.
• GATS helps countries open up their markets for
services and supports their development.
• It encourages gradual trade expansion while
respecting each country's policies and level of
development.
• Developing nations receive extra help through
specific commitments and assistance from the
World Trade Organization (WTO).

Trade-Related Aspects of Intellectual Property
Rights (TRIPS)
• TRIPS (Trade-Related Aspects of Intellectual
Property Rights) Agreement is essential for
international trade, focusing on innovation,
creativity, and branding value.
• It helps facilitate intellectual property trade and
resolves disputes among WTO members.
• Each country must provide minimum protection
for intellectual property owned by citizens of
other WTO members.
• Countries have flexibility to customize their
methods for IP protection and enforcement to
meet their needs and public policy objectives.
• TRIPS aims to strike a balance between
encouraging innovation and restricting access to
creative works.
• The agreement allows for exceptions to lower
short-term costs through various procedures.
copyright and patents).
• Similar to property rights in movable and
immovable property.

Industrial Property:
• Industrial property is a type of intellectual
property that includes inventions and industrial
designs.
• Inventions are new solutions to technological
problems.
• Industrial designs are aesthetic creations that
determine the appearance of industrial products.
• Industrial property also covers trademarks,
service marks, commercial names, and
designations, including indications of source and
appellations of origin.

The term "Industrial Property" may seem illogical
as it refers to inventions used in industries, but it
also includes trademarks and other marks used
in both commerce and industry.
• The Paris Convention recognizes industrial
property rights for patents, trademarks, service
marks, utility models, industrial designs, and
more.
• Industrial property rights encompass a person's
commercial or industrial activities, covering
inventions, creations, new products,
manufacturing methods, designs, and
distinguishing marks for goods, among others.

Patent:
• A patent is a monopoly award granting the
inventor control over the output and price of the
patented goods.
• Its primary economic justification is to
encourage investment in industrial innovation.
• Patents facilitate the maintenance and growth
of valuable, transferable, and industrial assets
through innovative technologies.
• An innovation that provides a new approach to
a problem or a new technical solution can be
patented.
• Patents give the inventor exclusive rights to the
invention, preventing others from making, using,
selling, or distributing it without permission.
• The patent holder can license the innovation to
others under mutually agreed terms or transfer
ownership.
• A patent is valid for 20 years from the date of
the patent application.
• After the patent expires, the invention becomes
part of the public domain, and anyone can use it
without the patent holder's permission.

Trade Mark:
• A trade mark differentiates goods of one
manufacturer or trader from similar goods of
others.
• It can be a combination of words, characters,
numbers, symbols, or images of people or
animals.
• Trade marks serve as effective advertising for
goods and their quality, establishing a
relationship between the merchant and the items
during commerce.
• Trademark law aims to give businesses
exclusive rights to use, share, or assign a mark
through registration.
• Service marks distinguish one company's
services from others.
• Like inventions and industrial designs, trade
marks are patentable.
They can include various combinations of words,
letters, numbers, symbols, images, and even
sounds.
• Trade marks are typically registered for seven
years but can be renewed indefinitely through
reapplication.
• Owners of trade marks have the sole right to
use them to distinguish their products or services
and can grant permission to others in exchange
for payment.
• Distinctive trade marks help consumers
recognize and choose goods or services based
on their nature and quality.

Copyright
• Origin: Copyright protection started with the
invention of printing, allowing mechanical
duplication of literary works.
• Privileges: Authorities and kings granted
exclusive rights of reproduction and distribution
for a limited period through privileges.
• The Statute of Anne: In 1709, the first copyright
statute was adopted to address criticisms of
privileges.
• Exclusive Right: Copyright emerged as an
exclusive right for authors to copy their literature
and prevent others from doing so.
• Expansion: Copyright laws expanded to cover
literary, artistic, musical works, sound
recordings, films, broadcasts, and more.
• Computer Programs: Computer programs are
also protected under copyright as products of
intellectual skill.
• Copyright Act in India: The Copyright Act in
India governs copyright law, amended multiple
times to adapt to technological advancements
and TRIPs agreement provisions.

Industrial Designs:
• Industrial designs are in the aesthetic field but
serve as patterns for manufacturing industrial or
handicraft products.
• An industrial design includes the ornamental or
aesthetic aspect of a useful article, appealing to
the sense of sight, such as shape, pattern, or
color.
• To be protected, an industrial design must be
new and original.
• Industrial designs are safeguarded against
unauthorized copying or limitation for a period
usually lasting for five, ten, or fifteen years.
• Textile designs were among the first to receive
legal protection.
• In 1787, the first Act for design protection was
enacted in Great Britain to encourage arts of
design and printing linens, cotton, calicoes, and
muslins for a limited time.
The laws relating to patents, designs, and
trademarks were later combined in the Patents,
Designs, and Trade Marks Act in 1883.
• The Indian Patents and Designs Act of 1911
was based on the (British) Patents and Designs
Act of 1907, and design provisions continue
under the Designs Act, 1911.
• The new Designs Act of 2000 has been passed
by the Parliament.

Geographical Indication (GI):
• Geographical Indication (GI) designates a
nation or location as the origin of a product.
• It guarantees quality and uniqueness due to its
geographical origin.
• GIs are exclusive privileges granted to a
community, benefiting all its members.
• Producers or traders from the location with
defining traits may use the GI.
• GIs are covered by WTO's TRIPS agreement,
promoting the protection of geographical
indicators. grants additional protection to
registered GIs. marketing plans, and more.
• The secrecy of trade secrets is essential to
maintain their competitive advantage.
• Trade secrets can be preserved indefinitely as
long as they remain confidential.
• Unauthorized means to obtain trade secrets are
not permissible.

National Intellectual Property Rights Policy:
• The Indian government provides exclusive
rights of intellectual property to safeguard
inventors' works.
• Intellectual property includes copyright, patents,
trademarks, trade names, industrial designs, and
merchandise.
• It ensures quality, safety, and effectiveness of
pharmaceutical products and services.
• The National Intellectual Property Rights Policy
encourages innovation and enhances the
business climate.

It aligns with India's focus on the "Decade of
Innovation."
• The Policy aims to improve access to
healthcare, food security, environmental
protection, and promote creativity and
innovation.
• The goals include creating awareness about
IPRs, stimulating IPR generation, strengthening
legal frameworks, modernizing administration,
commercializing IPRs, enforcing IPRs, and
developing human capital.




Lesson 16: Law relating to Patents
Regulatory Framework for Patents in India
• Patents Act, 1970, and Patents Rules, 2003
regulate patents in India.
• A patent is a statutory right granted for an
invention for a limited period.
• It gives the inventor exclusive rights to control
the patented product or process.
• The patent system stimulates investment in
industrial innovation.
• The Patents Act was enacted in 1970, with
subsequent amendments in 1995, 1999, 2002,
and 2005.
• Patents are granted to promote innovation and
commercial recognition.
• Compulsory licensing and registration of
process patents are also covered.
• Certain products like agricultural products and
nuclear energy inventions are not patentable.

In the case of Bishwanath Prasad Radhey
Shyam v. Hindustan Metal Industries, the
Hon'ble Supreme Court of India held that:
• The object of Patent law is to encourage
scientific research, new technology, and
industrial progress.
• Granting a limited-time monopoly to own, use,
or sell a patented method or product encourages
the development of new inventions with
commercial value.
• The disclosure of the invention to the Patent
Office, which becomes public domain after a
predetermined duration of the monopoly, is the
cost of the monopoly grant.




Advantages of Patents:
1. Exclusive Rights: Patentees have complete
control over their inventions and can prevent
others from making, using, or selling the
patented product without their permission.
2. Legal Protection: Patentees can enforce their
rights through legal means, filing suits for
infringement and seeking remedies like
injunctions, compensation, and accounting of
profits.
3. Commercial Exploitation: Patentees can
commercially exploit their inventions by selling or
licensing them to others, generating revenue and
profit.
4. Competitive Edge: Patents provide a
competitive advantage, as competitors are
restricted from using the patented technology,
giving the patentee a unique position in the
market.
5. Incentive for Innovation: Patents encourage
scientific research and new technological
developments, as inventors are rewarded for
their innovative contributions.
6. Recognition and Reputation: Having a patent
enhances the reputation of the inventor or the
company, signaling innovation and expertise in
the field.
7. Market Monopoly: Patents grant a limited-time
monopoly to the patentee, allowing them to
enjoy exclusive market rights and higher pricing
power.
8. Licensing Opportunities: Patentees can
license their technology to other companies,
creating collaboration and fostering innovation.
9. Technological Progress: Patents promote the
dissemination of knowledge, as inventors are
required to disclose their invention to the public
after a certain period.
10. Economic Growth: Patents contribute to
economic growth by encouraging investment in
research and development and promoting
technology transfer.

What can be Patented? An invention relating
either to a product or process that is new,
involving inventive step and capable of industrial
application can be patented. However, it must
not fall into the categories of inventions that are
non- patentable under sections 3 and
4 of the Act.

Invention and Patentability:
• Invention is defined under Section 2(1)(j) of the
Patents Act, 1970, as a new product or process
involving an inventive step and capable of
industrial application.
• Capable of industrial application means the
invention can be made or used in an industry, as
per Section 2(1)(ac) of the Act.
• New invention refers to any invention or
technology not anticipated by prior publication or
use before the filing date of the patent
application with complete specification.
• Inventive step involves aspects not obvious to a
person skilled in the relevant field.
• The patent system aims to stimulate innovative
practices and technological development for the
public interest.

What are not Inventions:
1. Frivolous Inventions: Inventions that are trivial
or obviously contrary to wellestablished natural
laws.
2. Contrary to Public Order or Morality:
Inventions that could be against public order or
morality, causing harm to human, animal, plant
life, or the environment.
3. Discoveries of Natural Substances: Mere
discoveries of scientific principles, abstract
theories, living or non-living substances
occurring in nature.
4. New Forms of Known Substances: Mere new
forms or uses of known substances unless they
result in enhanced efficacy.
5. Simple Aggregation: Mere arrangement or
duplication of known devices functioning
independently.
6. Methods of Agriculture or Horticulture:
Exclusion of patents for agricultural or
horticultural methods.
7. Medical Treatments: Processes for the
medical treatment of humans or animals.
8. Plants and Animals (excluding micro-
organisms): Patents not granted for plants and
animals, including seeds, varieties, and species,
and essentially biological processes for their
production or propagation.
9. Mathematical, Business Methods, and

15. Atomic Energy: No patents granted for
inventions related to atomic energy under the
Atomic Energy Act, 1962.




What are the Criteria of Patentability?
An invention is patentable subject matter if it
meets the following criteria - ? It should be novel.
? It should have inventive step or it must be non-
obvious.
? It should be capable of Industrial application.
? It should not attract the provisions of section 3
and 4 of the Patents Act, 1970.

Persons Entitled to make Application for Patent
• Section 6 of the Patents Act allows for the filing
of a patent application by different persons.
• The application can be made by the true and
first inventor of the invention (a).
• It can also be made by the assignee of the true
and first inventor, who has the right to file the
application (b).
• In case the inventor has passed away, the legal
representative of the deceased inventor can file
the application (c).
• The application can be made by any of these
persons alone or jointly with others.
• The term "assignee" includes the legal
representative of a deceased assignee, and
references to the assignee of any person include
references to the assignee of the legal
representative or assignee of that person.
Form of Application and Provisional & Complete
Specification
The Specification is a techno-legal document
containing scientific and technical disclosure and
claims for the invention which is the basis of
rights of a patent. The Specification, thus, forms
a crucial part of the patent application.
• Section 7 of the Patents Act requires every
patent application to be made for one invention
only.
• If the application is made based on an
assignment of the right to apply for a patent,
proof of the right must be furnished.
• International applications under the Patent
Cooperation Treaty (PCT) designating India are
deemed to be applications under the Act if a
corresponding application has also been filed
before the Controller in India.
• Applications filed under the Act, not being
convention applications or PCT applications,
must be accompanied by a provisional or
complete specification.
• If the application is accompanied by a
provisional specification, a complete
specification must be filed within twelve months
from the date of filing. Failure to do so will result
in the application being deemed abandoned.
• In some cases, where multiple applications by
the same applicant are related, the Controller
may allow one complete specification to cover all
provisional specifications.
• If an application is filed with a specification
purporting to be complete, the Controller may,
upon request, treat it as a provisional
specification within twelve months from the filing
date.
• A complete specification filed in response to a
provisional specification may be postdated to the
date of filing of the complete specification if
requested before the grant of the patent.

Contents of Specifications
• Patent Specifications: The patent specification
is a crucial document that describes the
invention and its operation. It must begin with a
clear title indicating the subject matter.
• Complete Specifications: A complete
specification provides a detailed description of
the invention, its method of operation, and the
best way to perform it. It must also include one
or more claims defining the scope of the
invention for which protection is sought.
• Provisional Specifications: Provisional
specifications are filed initially and must be
followed by a complete specification within
twelve months. Failure to do so may result in the
application being deemed abandoned.
• Abstract: Every specification must be
accompanied by an abstract that provides
technical information on the invention.
• Biological Materials: If the specification
mentions a biological material that cannot be
fully described, it must be deposited with an
International Depository Authority under the
Budapest Treaty.
• International Applications: International
applications designating India will be treated as
having a complete specification based on the
materials filed with the application.
• Commercial Gain: Patents are sought for
commercial gain, and exclusivity in the market is
achieved through clear and novel descriptions in
the patent specification.
• Exploitation of Patents: Patentees can exploit
their patents through marketing strategies,
licensing, or assignment to third parties.
• Increasing Monetary Value: The monetary
value of a patented invention can increase over
time.
• Rights and Exclusivity: Patents grant exclusive
commercial rights to the inventor, preventing
unauthorized usage by others.
• Commercial Strategies: Patents can be
commercially exploited through marketing
strategies and licensing agreements.

Publication of Patent Applications
• Section 11A of the Patents Act deals with the
publication of patent applications.
• Normally, patent applications are not made
public for a specific period, keeping the invention
confidential.
• An applicant can request the Controller to
publish their application before the prescribed
period if they want to make it public earlier.
• The publication includes important information
such as the date of application, application
number, applicant's name and address, and an
abstract of the invention.
• Some applications may not be published, like
those with secrecy directions, abandoned
applications, or withdrawn applications before
the prescribed period.
• Once an application is published, it becomes
accessible to the public.
• From the date of publication until the patent is
granted, the applicant has similar rights and
privileges as if the patent has been granted
already. However, they cannot take legal action
for infringement until the patent is granted.
• The rights of the patentee for applications
made before January 1, 2005, start from the date
of patent grant.
• After the patent is granted, the patent holder
can only receive a reasonable royalty from
certain enterprises that were already producing
and marketing the product before January 1,
2005. No infringement proceedings can be
started against such enterprises.


Request for Examination:
• An application for a patent must be examined
upon request by the applicant or any other
interested person.
• The request must be made within the
prescribed period.
Examination Process:
• The application and related documents are
referred to an examiner for a report.

Powers of the Controller:
• The Controller has the power to refuse the
application or require amendments if it does not
comply with the Act and rules.
• The Controller can post-date, amend, or refuse
the application based on the examination results.

Potential Infringement and Reference to Other
Patents
1. Patent Infringement:
• Patent infringement is the violation of the
exclusive rights of the patent holder.
• The Patents Act grants the patent holder the
exclusive right to prevent others from making,
using, selling, or manufacturing the patented
invention.
2. Exclusive Rights of Patent Holder:
• The patent holder has a monopoly over the
patented invention during the valid term of the
patent.
• Any activity that violates this monopoly can be
considered patent infringement.
3. Relief for Patent Infringement:
• In cases of patent infringement, the patent
holder can sue the infringing party for relief and
compensation.
4. Investigation by the Controller:
• The Controller can investigate if an invention in
a patent application may infringe another patent
claim.
• If substantial risk of infringement is found, the
Controller may direct a reference to the other
patent in the applicant's specification.
5. Inserting Reference to Another Patent:
• The reference to another patent is inserted in
the applicant's specification to inform the public
of the potential infringement.
6. Deletion of Reference:
• If the other patent is revoked, amended, or
found invalid, the Controller can delete the
reference in the applicant's specification.




Substitution of Applicants in Patent Applications
1. Section 20 of the Patents Act allows for the
substitution of applicants in a patent application.
2. If a claim is made in the prescribed manner
before the patent is granted, the Controller may
direct that the application shall proceed in the
name of the claimant or claimants instead of the
original applicant.
3. This claim can be based on an assignment or
agreement in writing made by the original
applicant, or by operation of law.
4. The Controller's direction may be given to
reflect the rightful ownership of the patent or an
undivided share of it.
5. For joint applicants, the direction can only be
given with the consent of the other joint
applicants.
6. If one of the joint applicants dies before the
patent is granted, the Controller may allow the
application to proceed in the name of the
surviving joint applicant(s) with the consent of
the deceased applicant's legal representative.
7. In case of disputes between joint applicants,
the Controller may give directions after hearing
all parties concerned to enable the application to
proceed or regulate its manner.
This provision ensures that the rightful owners or
claimants of the patent can be appropriately
reflected in the application, even if changes or
disputes arise during the process.
Time for Completing Patent Application Process
(Section 21)
• Section 21 of the Patents Act sets a time limit
for completing the patent application process.
• If the applicant fails to comply with all the
requirements imposed by the Act within the
prescribed period, the application is deemed
abandoned.
• The period starts from the date on which the
first statement of objections to the application or
complete specification is forwarded to the
applicant by the Controller.
• If any documents are returned to the applicant
during the proceedings, they must be re-filed or
explained to the Controller to be considered as
compliance.
• If an appeal to the High Court is pending for the
main invention or a patent of addition, the time
for compliance may be extended until the High
Court determines a date.
• If the appeal time has not expired, the
Controller may grant a further extension for
compliance.
• If the High Court grants an extension for
compliance during the further period, the
requirements must be met within the time
granted by the Court.

Opposition to the Grant of Patent (Section 25)
Section 25 of the Patents Act deals with the
process of opposing the grant of a patent. It
allows any person to file a written representation,
known as opposition, against the grant of

a patent. The opposition can be made on various
grounds, and the Controller will hear the
opposition and decide whether to grant the
patent or not.
The grounds for opposition include:
• Wrongful acquisition of the invention by the
applicant or someone related to them.
• Prior publication of the invention before the
priority date of the claim in another application or
document.
• Claiming the invention in a complete
specification published on or after the priority
date of the applicant's claim.
• Public knowledge or use of the invention in
India before the priority date of the claim.
• Obviousness of the invention, meaning it does
not involve any inventive step.
• Non-disclosure or false information provided by
the applicant to the Controller.
• Failure to disclose the source of geographical
origin of biological material used in the invention.
• Anticipation of the invention based on
knowledge available within any local or
indigenous community in India or elsewhere.

Section 25(2) allows any interested person to
oppose the grant of a patent by giving notice of
opposition to the Controller.
• The opposition can be made within one year
from the date of publication of the grant of the
patent.
• Grounds for opposition include wrongful
acquisition of the invention, prior publication of
the invention, lack of novelty or inventive step,
non-disclosure, false information by the
patentee, and anticipation of the invention based
on knowledge available within any local or
indigenous community in India or elsewhere.
• The Controller will hear the opposition and
decide whether to grant the patent or not based
on the grounds raised in the opposition.

Residents not to Apply for Patents Outside India
Without Prior Permission
• Section 39 of the Patents Act says that people
living in India cannot apply for patents in other
countries without permission.
• Before applying for a foreign patent, they must
get written permission from the Controller, a
government authority.
• They need to file their patent application in
India at least six weeks before applying abroad
and make sure no restrictions are in place.
The Controller must decide on the permit
application within a certain time, but if the
invention is related to defense or atomic energy,
the Central Government's consent is needed.
• The rule does not apply if someone living
outside India files the patent application in their
own country first.

GRANT OF PATENTS. Section 43
• Once an application for a patent is found to be
in order and meets all the requirements of the
Act, the patent is granted to the applicant or
applicants.
• If the Controller does not refuse the application
and finds it to be compliant with the Act, the
patent is granted as quickly as possible.
• The patent is granted with the seal of the
patent office, and the date of granting is
recorded in the register.
• The Controller is also required to publish the
grant of the patent, making the application,
specification, and related documents open for
public inspection

Grant of Patents Subject to Conditions
• Section 47 of the Patents Act deals with the
grant of patents subject to certain conditions.
• The grant of a patent comes with certain
conditions, such as allowing the government to
use the patented invention or process for its own
use.
• The government is permitted to import or make
any machine, apparatus, or article covered by
the patent solely for its own use.
• The government is also allowed to use any
process covered by the patent for its own use.
• Additionally, any person is permitted to use the
patented invention or process for the purpose of
experimentation or research, including
instructing students.
• For patents related to medicines or drugs, the
government is allowed to import and distribute
the medicine or drug for its own use or for use in
government medical institutions.


Rights of Patentees
• Section 48 of the Patents Act outlines the rights
granted to patentees.
• If the subject matter of the patent is a product,
the patentee has the exclusive right to prevent
others from making, using, offering for sale,
selling, or importing that product in India without
their consent.
If the subject matter of the patent is a process,
the patentee has the exclusive right to prevent
others from using that process and from using,
offering for sale, selling, or importing the product
obtained directly by that process in India without
their consent.

Term of Patent
• The term of a patent is 20 years from the date
of filing the patent application.
• For international applications filed under the
Patent Cooperation Treaty (PCT) designating
India, the term is 20 years from the international
filing date.
• If the renewal fee is not paid within the
prescribed period, the patent will cease to have
effect.
• Once the patent right ceases due to non-
payment of renewal fee or on the expiry of the
term, the subject matter covered by the patent
will no longer be protected.

Patents of Addition
• Patents of addition are granted for
improvements or modifications of an existing
invention described in the main patent
application.
• The Controller may grant a patent of addition if
the applicant requests it and if the main
invention is also the subject of a pending or
granted patent application.
• The term of a patent of addition is the same as
the term of the main patent or until the main
patent expires, whichever is earlier.
• No renewal fees are payable for patents of
addition, but if a patent of addition becomes an
independent patent, the same fees as for an
independent patent will be payable.
• The validity of patents of addition cannot be
questioned solely based on the lack of an
inventive step compared to the main invention or
any other improvement or modification of the
main invention.
Restoration of Lapsed Patents
• Restoring Lapsed Patents: If a patent has
expired because the renewal fee was not paid
on time, the patentee or their legal
representative can apply to get it reinstated.
• Time Limit: The application for restoration must
be made within eighteen months from the date
the patent lapsed.
• Joint Patents: If the patent was jointly held by
multiple people, one or more of them can apply
for restoration without involving the others.
• Controller's Decision: The application is
submitted to the Controller, who will review the
case and decide whether to grant or reject the
restoration.
• Timely Application: It is crucial to apply within
the specified time frame and provide valid
reasons for the delay in paying the renewal fee.
Restoration Approval: If the application is
approved, the patent will be restored, and its
validity will be reinstated.


Procedure for disposal of applications for
restoration of lapsed patents
• Application for Restoration: The patentee or
their legal representative can apply for
restoration of a lapsed patent by submitting an
application to the Controller.
• Prima Facie Satisfaction: The Controller will
review the application and, if prima facie
satisfied that the failure to pay the renewal fee
was unintentional and there was no undue delay
in applying for restoration, they will publish the
application.
• Opposition to Restoration: During the
publication period, any interested person can
oppose the restoration by giving notice to the
Controller. The opposition can be based on the
grounds that the failure to pay the renewal fee
was not unintentional or that there was undue
delay in applying for restoration.
• Opportunity to be Heard: If an opposition is
received, the Controller will notify the applicant
and the opponent and provide them with an
opportunity to be heard before making a
decision.
• Restoration Decision: If no opposition is
received or if the Controller's decision is in favor
of the applicant, the patent will be restored upon
payment of any unpaid renewal fee and
additional prescribed fees.
• Additional Requirements: The Controller may
require the applicant to enter certain documents
or information in the register as a condition of
restoring the patent.

Surrender and Revocation of Patent
• Surrender of Patent: The patentee can
voluntarily surrender their patent at any time by
giving notice to the Controller.
• Publication and Notice: The Controller will
publish the offer to surrender the patent and
notify other interested parties listed in the patent
register.
• Opposition to Surrender: Any interested person
can oppose the surrender of the patent by giving
notice to the Controller within the prescribed
period after publication.
• Decision: After hearing the patentee and any
opponent, if applicable, the Controller will decide
whether to accept the offer to surrender the
patent. If satisfied that the surrender is
appropriate, the Controller will revoke the patent
by order.

Revocation Grounds: A patent may be revoked
on the following grounds:
1. When the invention claimed in a valid claim
has an earlier priority date and is already
included in another granted patent in India.
2. When the patent application was filed by a
person who is not entitled under the Act and was
granted a patent on that application.
3. When the patent was wrongfully obtained, and
the rights of the petitioner or anyone claiming
through them were violated.
4. When the subject of a claim in the complete
specification is not an invention under the Act.
5. When the invention is not new or lacks
inventive step, considering what was publicly
known, used, or published before the priority
date of the claim.
6. When the invention is not useful.
7. When the description of the invention or
method in the complete specification is
insufficient to enable someone skilled in the art
to work the invention.
8. When the scope of any claim is not properly
defined or based on undisclosed matter.
9. When a false suggestion or representation
was made to obtain the patent.
10. When the subject of any claim is not
patentable under the Act.
11. When the invention was secretly used in
India before the priority date of the claim

Compulsory licenses
Compulsory licenses are permissions granted to
a third-party by the Controller General to use or
sell a patented product or use a patented
process without the patent owner's permission.
This concept is recognized both nationally in the
Indian Patent Act, 1970, and internationally in
the TRIPS Agreement. To obtain a compulsory
license, certain conditions specified in sections
84-92 must be met. These conditions ensure
that the compulsory license is granted in specific
situations and for valid reasons, such as the
public's reasonable requirements not being met
or the patented invention not being available at
an affordable price.

Section 84 of the Patent Act allows any
interested person to apply for a compulsory
license on a patent after three years from its
grant. The grounds for applying for a compulsory
license are as follows:
a) The reasonable needs of the public regarding
the patented invention have not been fulfilled.
b) The patented invention is not available to the
public at an affordable price.
c) The patented invention is not being used in
India.
Any person can apply for a compulsory license,
even if they already hold a license under the
patent. No one can be prevented from claiming
that the reasonable needs of the public are not
being met or that the patented invention is not
being used in India based on any previous
statements or actions.
The application for a compulsory license must
include a statement describing the applicant's
interest and the reasons for the application. The
Controller may grant the license if he is satisfied
that the reasonable needs of the public are not
being met or if the patented invention is not
being used in India, based on the provided
information

Revocation of Patents by the Controller for Non-
Working
1. Section 85 of the Patent Act deals with
revocation of patents for non-working.
2. After two years from the date of granting the
first compulsory license, the Central Government
or any interested person may apply for
revocation.
3. Grounds for revocation include: a) Non-
working of the patented invention in the territory
of India. b) Failure to meet the reasonable
requirements of the public. c) Not making the
patented invention available at a reasonably
affordable price.
4. The application for revocation should provide
specific details and facts supporting the grounds
for revocation.
5. The Controller will consider the application
and determine if a prima facie case for
revocation exists.
6. If satisfied, the Controller will direct the
applicant to serve copies of the application to the
patentee and others interested.
7. The application will be published in the Official
Journal.
8. The patentee or any other person can oppose
the application within the prescribed time and
provide reasons for opposition.
9. If an opposition is received, both parties will
have an opportunity to be heard before a
decision is made.
10. The Controller has the power to grant
compulsory licenses to applicants and may
direct licenses for other patents held by the
same patentee if reasonable requirements are
not met.
11. The Controller can also amend or cancel
existing licenses if necessary.

International Arrangements
1. Sections 133 to 139 of the Patent Act deal
with international arrangements.
2. Section 133 deals with convention countries,
which are countries or organizations that are
signatories to international treaties or
conventions related to patents and provide
similar privileges to applicants in India.
3. Section 134 notifies countries that do not
provide reciprocity in patent rights to citizens of
India. In such countries, Indian nationals cannot
apply for patents, be registered as patent
owners, or hold licenses under patents granted in
those countries.
4. Section 135 provides for convention
applications, allowing an applicant who has filed
for a patent in a convention country to claim
priority within 12 months of the first application's
filing date.
5. Section 136 contains special provisions for
convention applications, requiring a complete
specification and providing guidelines for the
application's date and content. 6. Section 137
allows for multiple priorities when an applicant
files similar patent applications in different
convention countries.
7. Section 138 requires the applicant of a
convention application to furnish copies of
specifications filed in convention countries and
verified by the Controller.
8. The Controller may not accept a convention
application post-dated beyond the date the
application could have been made under the Act

BENEFITS OF REGISTERING A TRADEMARK
ARE:
1. Legal Protection: Registration provides the
owner with exclusive legal rights to use the
trademark for the registered goods or services,
and it acts as evidence of ownership.
2. Brand Recognition: A registered trademark
helps create brand identity and recognition
among consumers, distinguishing the goods or
services from competitors.
3. Market Presence: A registered trademark
gives a competitive advantage in the market,
helping to build a strong brand presence and
reputation.
4. National and International Protection:
Registration offers protection not only within the
country but can also be used as a basis for
obtaining protection in other countries through
international treaties.
5. Prevents Infringement: Registering a
trademark allows the owner to take legal action
against any unauthorized use or infringement by
others.
6. Licensing and Franchising Opportunities:
Registered trademarks can be licensed or
franchised to other businesses, generating
additional revenue.
7. Asset Value: A registered trademark is
considered an intellectual property asset, and its
value can increase over time with the brand's
growth and reputation.
8. Trademark Symbol: Registered trademarks
can use the (r) symbol, which provides notice to
others about the trademark's registered status.
9. Trust and Credibility: Consumers often trust
registered trademarks more than unregistered
ones, as they indicate a commitment to quality
and authenticity.
10. Easy Enforcement: The registration helps
streamline the process of enforcing trademark
rights in case of infringement or counterfeit
products.


Section 9(1) of the Trade Marks Act contains
provisions related to absolute grounds for refusal
for trademark registration. According to this
section, the following types of trademarks shall
not be registered:
(a) Trademarks devoid of distinctive character:
Trademarks that are not capable of
distinguishing the goods or services of one
person from those of another person.
(b) Trademarks consisting exclusively of
descriptive marks: Marks or indications that may
serve to describe the kind, quality, quantity,
intended purpose, values, geographical origin, or
other characteristics of the goods or services.
(c) Trademarks consisting exclusively of
customary marks: Marks or indications that have
become customary in the current language or
bona fide and established practices of trade.
However, there is a proviso to this section that
states a trademark shall not be refused
registration if it has acquired a distinctive
character through prior use or if it is a well-known
trademark before the date of application for
registration. In such cases, the trademark may
still be eligible for registration.




Relative Grounds for Refusal of Registration
• Section 11(1) of the Trade Marks Act outlines
the absolute grounds for refusal of trademark
registration. Trademarks will not be registered if
they are identical or similar to an earlier
trademark and cover similar goods or services,
leading to a likelihood of confusion among the
public.
• Section 11(2) states that even if the goods or
services covered by the trademarks are not
similar, if the applied trademark is identical or
similar to an earlier well-known trademark in
India and its use without due cause would be
detrimental to the distinctive character or
reputation of the earlier trademark, it will not be
registered.
• Section 11(3) prohibits the registration of
trademarks that may be prevented from use in
India due to laws such as the law of passing off
or the law of copyright.
• Section 11(4) allows for the registration of a
trademark with the consent of the proprietor of
an earlier trademark or other earlier right.
• Section 11(6) defines the criteria for
determining a trademark as a well-known
trademark, considering factors such as
knowledge or recognition in the relevant section
of the public, duration, extent, and geographical
area of use and promotion, record of successful
enforcement of rights, and more.
• Section 11(7) clarifies that the Registrar shall
not require specific conditions like use in India or
registration in India for determining whether a
trademark is well-known.
• Section 11(8) ensures that the Registrar
protects a well-known trademark against
identical or similar trademarks and considers the
bad faith of the applicant or opponent during the
application and opposition process.
• Section 11(9) states that the registration of a
trademark acquired in good faith and disclosing
all material information will not be prejudiced
based on its similarity to a well-known
trademark.

Section 13 of the Trade Marks Act prohibits the
registration of certain names as trademarks:
• Names that are commonly used and accepted
names of single chemical elements or
compounds (not mixtures) in relation to a
chemical substance or preparation.
• Names declared by the World Health
Organization and notified by the Registrar as
international non-proprietary names or
deceptively similar names.
Any registration of such names as trademarks
shall be considered as an entry made in the
register without sufficient cause or an entry
wrongly remaining on the register, as per section
57 of the Act


According to the Trade Marks Act, if an
application for the registration of a trademark
falsely suggests a connection with any living
person or a person who has passed away within
twenty years prior to the application date, the
Registrar may require the applicant to provide
written consent from the living person or the
legal representative of the deceased person to
the connection depicted on the trademark. The
Registrar may refuse to proceed with the
application if the required consent is not
provided by the applicant.


Registration
• Registration of a trademark is subject to the
provisions of Section 19.
• If the application has not been opposed within
the specified time or the opposition has been
decided in favor of the applicant, the Registrar
must register the trademark within eighteen
months of the application filing date.
• The registered trademark will be considered as
of the date of the application filing.
• The Registrar will issue a certificate of
registration to the applicant, sealed with the seal
of the Trade Marks Registry.
• If the registration process is not completed
within twelve months due to the applicant's
default, the Registrar may treat the application
as abandoned after giving notice to the
applicant.
• The Registrar has the authority to amend the
register or a certificate of registration to correct
clerical errors or obvious mistakes.

Duration, Renewal, Removal and Restoration of
Registration
• Section 25 of the Act deals with the duration,
renewal, removal, and restoration of trademark
registration.
• Trademark registration is initially granted for a
period of 10 years.
• Registration can be renewed for successive
periods of 10 years from the date of the original
registration or the last renewal.
• Section 25(4) allows for the restoration of
removed trademarks on payment of the renewal
fee.

Infringement of Registered Trade Marks -
Section 29

Section 29(1) provides that a registered trade
mark is infringed by a person who, not being a
registered proprietor or a person using by way of
permitted use, uses in the course of trade, a
mark which is identical with, or deceptively
similar to, the trade mark in relation to goods or
services in respect of which the trade mark is
registered and in such manner as to render the
use of the mark likely to be taken as being used
as a trade mark.
As per section 29(2) of the Act, a registered
trade mark is infringed by a person who, not
being a registered proprietor or a person using
by way of permitted use, uses in the course of
trade, a mark which because of-
(a) its identity with the registered trade mark and
the similarity of the goods or services covered by
such registered trade mark; or
(b) its similarity to the registered trade mark and
the identity or similarity of the goods or services
covered by such registered trade mark; or
(c) its identity with the registered trade mark and
the identity of the goods or services covered by
such registered trade mark, is likely to cause
confusion on the part of the public, or is likely to
have an association with the registered trade
mark.


Section 29(3) states that in any case falling
under section 29(2)(c), the court shall presume
that it is likely to cause confusion on the part of
the public.

Section 29(4) provides that a registered trade
mark is infringed by a person who, not being a
registered proprietor or a person using by way of
permitted use, uses in the course of trade, a
mark which-
(a) is identical with or similar to the registered
trade mark; and
(b) is used in relation to goods or services which
are not similar to those for which the trade mark
is registered; and
(c) the registered trade mark has a reputation in
India and the use of the mark without due cause
takes unfair advantage of or is detrimental to, the
distinctive character or repute of the registered
trade mark.

According to Section 29(5) of the Act, a
registered trade mark is infringed by a person if
he uses such registered trade mark, as his trade
name or part of his trade name, or name of his
business concern or part of the name, of his
business concern dealing in goods or services in
respect of which the trade mark is registered.

Section 29(6) provides that a person uses a
registered mark, if, in particular, he:-
(a) affixes it to goods or the packaging thereof;
(b) offers or exposes goods for sale, puts them
on the market, or stocks them for those
purposes under the registered trade mark, or
offers or supplies services under the registered
trade mark;
(c) imports or exports goods under the mark; or
(d) uses the registered trade mark on business
papers or in advertising
Section 29(7) states that a registered trade mark
is infringed by a person who applies such
registered trade mark to a material intended to
be used for labeling or packaging goods, as a
business paper, or for advertising goods or
services, provided such person, when he applied
the mark, knew or had reason to believe that the
application of the mark was not duly authorised
by the proprietor or a licensee.

As per Section 29(8) a registered trade mark is
infringed by any advertising of that trade mark if
such advertising:-

Section 30 of the Act provides instances where
the use of a registered trademark does not
constitute infringement:
1. Use for Identifying Goods or Services: The
use of a registered trademark to identify goods
or services as those of the proprietor is permitted
if it is in accordance with honest practices in
commercial matters and does not take unfair
advantage or harm the distinctive character of
the trademark.
2. Use Indicating Characteristics: Use of a
trademark to indicate characteristics such as
kind, quality, quantity, intended purpose, value,
geographical origin, time of production, or
rendering of services does not constitute
infringement.
3. Use Under Certain Conditions or Limitations: If
a trademark is registered subject to certain
conditions or limitations, its use within those
specified conditions or limitations does not
infringe the trademark rights.
4. Use by Proprietor or Registered User: The use
of a trademark by the proprietor or a registered
user in relation to goods connected with the
proprietor or user does not infringe the
trademark rights, provided the use conforms to
the permitted use.
5. Use for Goods Accessory to Other Goods:
The use of a trademark for goods that are
intended to form part of or be accessory to other
goods or services where the mark has been
used without infringement or might be so used is
not considered infringement.
6. Use of Identical or Similar Trademarks: The
use of a registered trademark, one of two or
more identical or similar trademarks registered
under the Act, does not constitute infringement if
exercised under the right given by registration

PASSING OF
• Growth in Trade and Commerce: The rapid
expansion of trade and commerce has led to an
increase in the imitation of well-known or
reputable trademarks by competitors and other
traders.
• Imitation of Trademarks: Competitors may
imitate the color scheme, get-up, or packaging of
well-known trademarks with the intention of
passing off their goods as those of the genuine
owner.
• Infringement of Registered Trademarks: In
cases of registered trademarks, the owner can
seek legal recourse for infringement under the
Trade Marks Act.
• Passing Off: For unregistered trademarks, the
Act recognizes the common law remedy of
passing off. Passing off is a legal action based
on the principle that no one is allowed to
represent their goods as those of another
person, and no one is required to use any mark
or symbol that enables a false representation to
be made to an ultimate purchaser.
• Principle of Passing Off: Passing off is based
on the principle that no one should deceive
consumers by falsely representing their goods as
those of another, thereby protecting the
reputation and goodwill associated with a
particular trademark.

Factors for Deciding Deceptive Similarity in
Passing Off Cases:
1. Nature of Marks: Consider whether the marks
are word marks, label marks, or composite
marks (both words and labels).
2. Resemblance: Evaluate the degree of
similarity between the marks, including phonetic
similarity and similarity in idea.
3. Nature of Goods: Examine the nature of the
goods for which the marks are used as
trademarks.
4. Similarity of Goods: Assess the similarity in
nature, character, and performance of the goods
offered by rival traders.
5. Class of Purchasers: Consider the class of
purchasers who are likely to buy the goods
bearing the marks, their education, intelligence,
and degree of care exercised in purchasing or
using the goods.
6. Mode of Purchasing: Analyze the mode of
purchasing the goods or placing orders for the
goods.
7. Surrounding Circumstances: Take into
account any other relevant surrounding
circumstances that may indicate dissimilarity
between the competing marks.
• Weightage: Assign weightage to each factor
based on the facts of the individual case,
recognizing that the same weightage cannot be
given to each factor in every case.

Assignment and Transmission
• Section 37: Allows the registered proprietor of a
trademark to assign the trademark and give
receipts for consideration received in such
assignments.
• Section 38: Deals with the assignability and
transmissibility of a registered trademark with or
without goodwill of the business, either in respect
of all goods or services or a part thereof.
• Section 39: Permits the assignment or
transmission of an unregistered trademark with
or without the goodwill of the business
concerned.
• Section 40: Contains restrictions on
assignments or transmissions of trademarks that
could create multiple exclusive rights in different
persons for the same or similar goods/services,
which may cause confusion or deception.
• Section 42: Outlines conditions for the
assignment of a trademark without the goodwill
of the business, requiring directions from the
Registrar and advertising the assignment
accordingly.
• Section 43: States that certification trade marks
can only be assigned with the consent of the
Registrar.
• Section 44: Allows associated trademarks to be
assignable and transmissible only as a whole,
but they will be treated as separate trademarks
for all other purposes.
• Section 45: Specifies the procedure for
registration of assignments and transmissions,
requiring the Registrar to refuse registration if
the validity of an assignment is in dispute
between the parties unless determined by a
competent court.




Appointment of Registrar and Trade Mark
Registry
• Section 3: Deals with the appointment of the
Registrar and other officers responsible for the
administration of trademark matters.
• Section 4: Empowers the Registrar to withdraw
any pending matter before an officer and handle
it personally or transfer it to another officer, with
proper reasons recorded for such transfer.
• Section 5: Establishes the Trade Marks
Registry and its branch offices, clarifying that the
existing Trade Marks Registry under the Trade
and Merchandise Marks Act, 1958 will continue
to function as the Trade Marks Registry for the
purposes of the Trade Marks Act.

Trade Mark Agent
Section 145 of the Trade Marks Act deals with
agents and their role in performing acts required
before the Registrar. The section allows the
following persons to act as authorized agents on
behalf of the principal:
(a) Legal Practitioner: A qualified lawyer or
attorney can act as an agent.
(b) Registered Trade Marks Agent: A person
registered in the prescribed manner as a trade
marks agent can act on behalf of the principal.
(c) Employee of the Principal: A person who is in
the sole and regular employment of the principal
can also act as an agent.

a person shall be qualified to be registered as a
trademarks agent if he-

right with its roots in the common law system.
2. It grants the exclusive right to authors to copy
their literary or artistic works and prevent others
from doing so.
3. Copyright protection has expanded with
technological advancements, covering various
forms of creativity.
4. In India, the Copyright Act, 1957 governs
copyright law, and it has undergone several
amendments.
5. Copyright law covers literary, music, software,
graphics, choreography, movies, and more.
6. It protects the work of creators regardless of
content or quality.
7. Although registration is not mandatory, it is
advisable to register the work to secure
copyright protection.
8. Copyright (or author's right) is a legal term
used to describe the rights that creators have
over their literary and artistic works. Works
covered by copyright range from books, music,
paintings, sculpture, and films, to computer
programs, databases, advertisements, maps,
and technical drawings
9. The object of copyright is to protect and
reward authors' labor on their created work.
10. Copyright protects the "type of material
communication," not individual concepts, ideas,
techniques, or details.
11. Copyright protection requires the work to be
set in a physical form, such as stories written on
paper or initial canvas paintings.
12. Copyright protects various forms of work,
including song lyrics, books, images, computer
programs, etc.
13. Copyright does not protect ideas, titles,
names, or details.
14. Publishing is important as it grants the
author exclusive rights to replicate, create
derivative works, distribute, sell, and publicly
perform their copyrighted works.
15. The author can grant these rights as a
package or separately, which can help generate
income if others reproduce the work.

related to the registration of copyright societies:
1. Establishment: Copyright societies are
established under Section 33 of the Copyright
Act, 1957.

societies is to administer the rights of creators
and copyright owners, including the collection
and distribution of royalties for the use of
copyrighted works.
3. Application for Registration: A copyright
society seeking registration must make an
application to the Central Government in the
prescribed form.
4. Criteria for Registration: The Central
Government, after examining the application,
may grant registration if it is satisfied that the

practices.
5. Terms and Conditions: The registration of a
copyright society is subject to terms and
conditions prescribed by the Central
Government.
6. Registration as a Licensing Body: Once
registered, the copyright society becomes a
licensing body authorized to issue licenses for
the use of copyrighted works and collect
royalties on behalf of the copyright owners.
7. Cancellation of Registration: The Central
Government has the power to cancel the
registration of a copyright society if it fails to
comply with the prescribed conditions or is found

8. Transparency and Accountability: Copyright
societies are required to maintain transparency
in their operations and are subject to regulatory
oversight to ensure fair management of
copyright-related matters.

Section 37 of the Copyright Act grants
broadcasting organizations a special right known
as the "broadcast reproduction right" for their
broadcasts. Here are the key points related to
the broadcast reproduction right:
1. Broadcasting Organization's Right: Section 37
gives every broadcasting organization the
exclusive right to be known as the "broadcast
reproduction right" for its broadcasts.
2. Duration of the Right: The broadcast
reproduction right subsists for a period of
twentyfive years from the beginning of the
calendar year next following the year in which the
broadcast is made.
3. Activities Covered: During the continuance of
the broadcast reproduction right, certain
activities related to the broadcast are restricted,
including re-broadcasting, causing the broadcast
to be heard or seen by the public for payment,
making sound or visual recordings of the
broadcast, and reproducing such recordings.
4. Licensing: To perform the restricted activities,
a person must obtain a license from the
broadcasting organization, and any unlicensed
activity or use beyond the scope of the license is
prohibited.
Overall, the broadcast reproduction right grants
broadcasting organizations the exclusive control
over certain activities related to their broadcasts
for a specific period, ensuring that their works
are protected and fairly used


Performer's Right:
• Section 38 of the Copyright Act grants
performers a special right known as the

fifty years from the beginning of the calendar
year next following the year in which the
performance is made.
• Section 38A provides performers with an
exclusive right to control certain acts in relation
to their performances, including making sound or
visual recordings, issuing copies, communicating
to the public, selling or renting copies, and
broadcasting or communicating the performance
to the public.
• Performers also have moral rights, which
include the right to be identified as the performer
of their performance and the right to prevent any
distortion, mutilation, or modification of their
performance that may harm their reputation.

Copyright Protection to Foreign Works
Copyright protection to foreign works in India is
governed by the provisions of the Copyright Act,
1957. The Act provides certain protections and
rights to foreign authors and creators, as well as
works that originate from foreign countries.
Key provisions related to copyright protection to
foreign works in India:
1. Berne Convention: India is a member of the
Berne Convention for the Protection of Literary
and Artistic Works. As a result, works originating
in any member country of the Berne Convention
are given the same copyright protection in India
as works created by Indian authors.
2. International Copyright Relations: India has
also signed various international agreements and
treaties, such as the Universal Copyright
Convention (UCC) and the Trade-Related
Aspects of Intellectual Property Rights (TRIPS)
Agreement under the World Trade Organization
(WTO), which provide additional protections to
foreign works in India.
3. No Formalities: Foreign works are granted
copyright protection in India without the need for
any formalities or registration. As soon as a work
is created and qualifies for copyright protection,
it is automatically protected.
4. Duration of Copyright: The duration of
copyright protection for foreign works in India is
typically the same as for works created by Indian
authors. For literary, dramatic, musical, and
artistic works, copyright generally subsists for the
lifetime of the author plus 60 years from the
beginning of the calendar year following the
author's death.
5. Enforcement: Foreign authors and copyright
owners have the same rights to enforce their
copyrights in India as Indian authors. They can
take legal action against copyright infringement
and seek remedies in Indian courts.
Overall, India provides adequate copyright
protection to foreign works, and copyright
owners from other countries can avail
themselves of the same rights and remedies as
Indian authors and creators in protecting their
intellectual property.




The key points related to copyright registration
are as follows:
1. Not Compulsory: Copyright registration is not
compulsory, and an author can still bring an
action for copyright infringement even without
registration.
2. Enabling Provisions: Sections 44 and 45 of
the Act are enabling provisions, allowing authors
or owners of copyrighted works to apply for
registration voluntarily.
3. Prima Facie Evidence: Copyright registration
serves as prima facie evidence of the particulars
entered in the copyright register.
4. Application Process: To apply for copyright
registration, the author or owner of the work
needs to submit an application in the prescribed
form to the Registrar of Copyrights along with
the prescribed fee.
5. Optional Artistic Work Declaration: If an artistic
work is used or capable of being used in relation
to goods or services, the application should
include a statement to that effect, accompanied
by a certificate from the Registrar of Trade
Marks.
6. Registrar's Discretion: The Registrar of
Copyrights may conduct an inquiry and decide
whether to enter the particulars of the work in the
Copyright Register.

The procedure for copyright registration in India
is outlined below:
Step 1: Application Form The applicant (author,
owner, or publisher) needs to fill out the
appropriate application form prescribed under
the Copyright Rules, 2013. The application

from the author or other copyright owner, in case
the applicant is not the author or original
copyright holder.
Step 3: Fee Payment The prescribed fee must
be paid along with the application. The fee varies
based on the type of work and mode of filing
(online or physical submission). Step 4:

Lesson 19: Law relating to Geographical
Indications of Goods
INTRODUCTION:
• Geographical Indications (GI) are marks that
identify products as originating from a specific
region, guaranteeing quality and uniqueness due
to their origin.
• GI protection prevents counterfeit products
from tarnishing the reputation of genuine goods
and benefits both producers and consumers.
• Regions specializing in unique products like
silk, cotton, and spices gained global
recognition, linking product qualities to their
geographical locality.
• GI concept has evolved over centuries,
reflecting traditional expertise passed down
through generations.
• GI falls under the TRIPS Agreement, part of the
WTO, and includes indications identifying goods
originating from a specific country, region, or
locality, with specific qualities attributed to their
geographical origin.
• India enacted a sui generis legislation in 1999
to protect GI after joining the TRIPS Agreement.
Geographical Indication
* Geographical Indication (GI) in relation to
goods identifies agricultural, natural, or
manufactured products as originating from a
specific territory, region, or locality.
* It signifies that the quality, reputation, or other
characteristic of the goods is essentially linked to
their geographical origin.
* For manufactured goods, at least one of the
production, processing, or preparation activities
must occur in the specified territory.
* The name need not be the name of a country,
region, or locality; it can also be a specific
geographical area related to the goods.

* GI protection ensures that the unique qualities
and reputation of goods from a particular region
are preserved and distinguished from imitations
or counterfeit products.

• It is an indication.
• It originates from a definite geographical
territory.
• It is used to identify agricultural, natural or
manufactured goods.
• The manufactured goods should be produced
or processed or prepared in that territory.
• It should have a special quality or reputation or
other characteristics.
It may be noted that: Goods means any
agricultural, natural or manufactured goods or
any goods of handicraft or of industry and
includes food stuff. Indication includes any
name, geographical or figurative representation
or any combination of them conveying or
suggesting the geographical origin of goods to
which it applies.

Prohibition of Registration of Certain
Geographical Indications
Section 9 of the Act prohibits registration of
certain geographical indications. They are as
follows:-
(a) the use of which would be likely to deceive or
cause confusion; or
(b) the use of which would be contrary to any law
for the time being in force; or
(c) which comprises or contains scandalous or
obscene matter; or
(d) which comprises or contains any matter likely
to hurt the religious susceptibilities of any class
or section of the citizens of India; or
(e) which would otherwise be disentitled to
protection in a court; or
(f) which are determined to be generic names or
indications of goods and are, therefore, not or
ceased to be protected in their country of origin,
or which have fallen into disuse in that country;
or
(g) which, although literally true as to the
territory, region or locality in which the goods
originate, but falsely represent to the persons
that the goods originate in another territory,
region or locality, as the case may be;

Geographical Indication of Goods - Registration
Process
1. File the application: The association
representing the producers of the concerned
goods files the application for Geographical
Indication (GI) registration.
2. Preliminary Scrutiny and Examination: The
application is scrutinized for any deficiencies or
errors. The content of the statement of case is
assessed by a group of experts.
3. Show Cause Notice: If there are objections to
the application, the Registrar issues a show
cause notice. The applicant must respond or
request a hearing.
4. Publication in the Geographical Indications
Journal: The accepted application is published in
the Geographical Indications Journal.
5. Opposition to Registration: Any person can file
a notice of opposition within three months of
publication, opposing the GI application. Both
sides provide evidence and a hearing is
conducted.
6. Registration: If the application is accepted and
no opposition is successful, the GI is registered,
and a certificate is issued.

7. Renewal: The registered GI is valid for 10
years and can be renewed by paying the
renewal fee.
8. Additional Protection to Notified Goods:
Additional protection is provided for notified
goods under the Act.
9. Appeal: Any person aggrieved by an order or
decision can prefer an appeal.

Infringement of Registered Geographical
Indications
Infringement of a registered Geographical
Indication (GI) occurs when a person uses the GI
or a deceptively similar indication without proper
authorization, thereby misleading the public
about the true origin of the goods or services.
Section 22 of the Geographical Indications of
Goods (Registration and Protection) Act, 1999
deals with the infringement of a registered GI.
According to Section 22, the following actions
shall be deemed as infringement of a registered
GI:
1. The use of a GI by any person in the course of
trade for goods or services which are not
originating from the geographical area indicated
by the registered GI, in a manner that misleads
the public about the true origin of such goods or
services.
2. Any use of a GI that constitutes an unfair trade
practice, taking unfair advantage of the
reputation of the registered GI.
3. Any use of a GI that causes detriment to the
registered GI's distinctive character, reputation,
or quality.
In case of infringement, the registered proprietor
of the GI or any authorized person may file a civil
suit in a court of competent jurisdiction seeking
remedies such as injunctions, damages, or
account of profits. The Act also provides for
criminal penalties for willful infringement of a
registered GI, which includes imprisonment and
fine.


Meaning of Applying Geographical Indications
Section 37 of the Act provides that a person
shall be deemed to apply a geographical
indication to goods who:
(a) applies it to the goods themselves; or
(b) applies it to any package in or with which the
goods are sold, or exposed for sale, or had in
possession for sale or for any purpose of trade
or manufacture; or
(c) places, encloses or annexes any goods which
are sold, or exposed for sale, or had in
possession for sale or for any purpose of trade
or manufacture, in or with any package or other
thing to which a geographical indication has been
applied; or
(d) uses a geographical indication in any manner
reasonably likely to lead to the belief that the
goods in connection with which it is used are
designated or described by that geographical
indication; or
(e) in relation to the goods uses a geographical
indication in any sign, advertisement, invoice,
catalogue, business letter, business paper, price
list or other commercial documents and goods
are delivered to a person in pursuance of a
request or order made by reference to the
geographical indication as so used.
A geographical indication shall be deemed to be
applied to goods whether it is woven in,
impressed on, or otherwise worked into, or
annexed or affixed to, the goods or to any
package or other thing

Falsifying and Falsely Applying Geographical
Indications
Section 38 states that a person shall be deemed
to falsify a geographical indication who, either:
(a) without the assent of the authorised user of
the geographical indication makes that
geographical indication or deceptively similar
geographical indication; or
(b) falsifies any genuine geographical indication,
whether by alteration, addition, effacement or
otherwise.

A person shall be deemed to falsely apply to
goods a geographical indication who, without the
assent of the authorised user of the geographical
indication:
(a) applies such geographical indication or a
deceptively similar geographical indication to
goods or any package containing goods;
(b) uses any package bearing a geographical
indication which is identical with or deceptively
similar to the geographical indication of such
authorised user, for the purpose of packing,
filling or wrapping therein any goods other than
the genuine goods of the authorised user of the
geographical indication.
Any geographical indication falsified or falsely
applied referred to as a false geographical
indication.

Penalty for Applying False Geographical
Indications
Section 103 of the Act deals with the penalty for
applying false geographical indications. If any
person applies a false geographical indication to
any goods or provides any false information that
a geographical indication has been registered,
he shall be punishable with imprisonment for a
term which may extend to two years or with a
fine which may extend to Rs. 50,000, or with
both.

Lesson 20: Law relating to Designs
INTRODUCTION:
- Industrial designs pertain to the ornamental or
formal appearance of a product.
- Design right protects novel or original designs
granted to the registered proprietor.
- The Designs Act, 2000 governs the protection
of industrial designs in India.
- It replaced the Patents and Designs Act, 1911,
to comply with TRIPS after India joined the WTO
in 1995.
- The objective is to safeguard new or original
designs applied to specific articles made through
industrial processes.
- Registration ensures creators of aesthetically
pleasing designs are rewarded and their rights
are protected.
- The law prohibits registration of designs that
are not new, original, or significantly
distinguishable from known designs.
- The Designs Act aims to strike a balance
between encouraging innovation and protecting
the rights of designers.

Summary of Supreme Court's observation in the
case of Bharat Glass Tube Limited vs. Gopal
Glass Works Limited:
• The Designs Act, 2000 was introduced to
replace the outdated Designs Act of 1911 to
protect industrial designs.
• The purpose of the Act is to promote design
activity and protect intellectual property rights of
original designs.
• The Act ensures protection for a period of ten
years for new and original designs that have not
been previously registered or published.
• The Act prohibits registration of designs that
are not new, original, or significantly
distinguishable from known designs.
• Designs that have been disclosed to the public
or are not registerable under the Act are not
eligible for registration.
• The Act provides for cancellation of registration
if a design does not meet the criteria or has been
previously registered or published.
• The sole aim of the Act is to safeguard the
rights of designers who have put in research and
labor to create new and original designs.
• Designs that meet the requirements of the Act
are granted protection for a period of ten years.
• The Act aims to strike a balance between
protecting intellectual property rights and
promoting free use of available designs.
Design
• Design refers to the features of shape,
configuration, pattern, ornament, or composition
of lines or color applied to any article.
• It can be two-dimensional or three-dimensional
or a combination of both.
• The design should be applied to the article by
any industrial process or means, whether
manual, mechanical, or chemical.
• The design should appeal to and be judged
solely by the eye in the finished article.
• Designs that are mere mechanical devices,
trade marks, property marks, or artistic works as
defined under other acts are not considered as
designs under this section. An artistic work as
defined under Section 2(c) of the Copyright Act,
1957 is not a subject matter for registration
which reads as follows: "Artistic works" means: -
A painting, a sculpture, a drawing (including a
diagram, map, chart or plan) on engraving or a
photograph, whether or not such work
possesses artistic quality;
An work of architecture; and
Any other work of artistic craftsmanship.
A design or pattern covers the whole body or the
goods and forms part and parcel or the goods
but a trade mark is apart from and different from
the goods for denoting the goods to be the
manufacture or merchandise of a particular
person. The copying of a design cannot,
therefore, be treated as counterfeiting a trade
mark

Article means any article of manufacture and any
substance, artificial, or partly artificial and partly
natural; and includes any part of an article
capable of being made and sold separately

Proprietor of a New or Original Design
• In cases where the author of the design
executes the work for someone else for good
consideration, the person for whom the design is
executed is considered as the proprietor of the
design.
• If any person acquires the design or the right to
apply the design to any article exclusively or
otherwise, that person is considered the
proprietor of the design to the extent of the
acquisition.
• In any other case, the author of the design is
considered the proprietor.
• If the property in or the right to apply the design
is transferred from the original proprietor to
another person, that person is also included as
the proprietor of the design.


Prohibition of Registration of Certain Designs
A design which prohibited of registration under
Section 4 of the Design Act, 2000 are as follows:
• is not new or original; or
• has been disclosed to the public anywhere in
India or in any other country by publication in
tangible form or by use or in any other way prior
to the filing date, or where applicable, the priority
date of the application for registration; or
• is not significantly distinguishable from known
designs or combination of known designs; or
• comprises or contains scandalous or obscene
matter, shall not be registered.

Application for Registration of Designs (Section
5)
Section 5 of the Designs Act deals with the
application for registration of designs. Here are
the key points related to the application process:
1. Application Filing: Any person claiming to be
the proprietor of a new or original design may
apply for its registration by submitting an
application to the Controller of Designs. 2.
Contents of Application: The application must
contain the prescribed information and
representations or drawings of the design.
3. Priority Date: The date of application shall be
the priority date for the registration of the design.
4. Multiple Designs: An application may relate to
one or more designs if they belong to the same
class of articles.
5. Examination: The Controller will examine the
application to ensure it complies with the
requirements and may request additional
information or amendments if needed.
6. Publication: After examination, the Controller
will publish the application in the Official Journal,
and it will be open for public inspection.
7. Opposition: Within four months of the
publication, any person may oppose the
registration of the design by filing a notice of
opposition with the Controller.
8. Registration: If there is no opposition or the
opposition is resolved in favor of the applicant,
the Controller will register the design and issue a
certificate of registration. The application
process for registration of designs aims to
protect new and original designs from being
copied or used by others without permission,
providing exclusive rights to the proprietor of the
design.




Publication of Particulars of Registered Designs
Section 7 of the Act provides that the Controller
shall, as soon as may be after the registration of
a design, cause publication of the prescribed
particulars of the design to be published in such
manner as may be prescribed and thereafter the
design shall be open to public inspection.

Substitution of Applicant or Joint Claiming
(Section 8)
• The original applicant for a design registration
can be substituted by any other person who
claims to be the proprietor of the design.
• The Controller of Designs has the authority to
allow such substitution upon application and
payment of the prescribed fee.
• The Controller may also allow for joint claiming
of the design by multiple persons if they claim to
be joint proprietors.
• The joint claimants must apply together and
submit their request for joint claiming along with
the prescribed fee.
• The Controller will record the substitution or
joint claiming in the Register of Designs after due
verification.
• Any subsequent alteration or change in the
proprietorship details of the design must also be
notified to the Controller to keep the records
updated.
Copyright on Registration
Section 11 provides that when a design is
registered, the registered proprietor of the design
shall, subject to the provisions of this Act, have
copyright in the design during ten years from the
date of registration. However, before the
expiration of the said ten years, application for
the extension of the period of copyright is made
to the Controller in the prescribed manner, the
Controller shall, on payment of the prescribed
fee, extend the period of copyright for a second
period of five years from the expiration of the
original period of ten years

The High Court of Delhi in the case of
Microfibers Inc. vs. Girdhar and Co. and Anr. laid
down the following guidelines:
1. The definition of artistic work is broad and
includes works with or without artistic quality,
even abstract works like lines or curves arbitrarily
drawn.
2. The holder of an original artistic work has
exclusive rights under Section 14(c) of the
Copyright Act, including the right to reproduce
the work in any material form.
3. Design protection under the Designs Act
cannot be extended to include copyright
protection for industrially produced works.

4. Original paintings/artistic works used for
industrial production still fall within the definition
of artistic work and are entitled to full copyright
protection.
5. Copyright protection for original artistic works
continues to exist even if the intention is for
industrial production.
6. Copyright protection ceases for registered
designs under the Copyright Act, and copyright
protection is not granted for unregistered
designs applied more than 50 times by industrial
process.
7. Copyright for original artistic works persists,
and the author/holder enjoys the longer
protection granted under the Copyright Act for
the original artistic work itself.

Restoration of Lapsed Designs
Section 12 of the Act deals with the restoration
of a design that has ceased to have effect due to
failure to pay the fee for the extension of
copyright. The key points are:
1. If a design has lost its copyright protection due
to non-payment of the extension fee, the
proprietor or their legal representative can apply
for restoration within one year from the date it
ceased to have effect.
2. If the design was held jointly by multiple
persons, one or more of them can apply for
restoration with the Controller's permission,
without the need for all joint holders to join the
application.
3. The application for restoration must be made
in the prescribed manner and accompanied by
the prescribed fee.
4. The application should include a statement
verified in the prescribed manner, explaining the
circumstances that led to the failure to pay the
fee.
5. The Controller may request further evidence
from the applicant if deemed necessary.

Piracy of Registered Design
During the existence of copyright in any design it
shall not be lawful for any person, without the
license or written consent of the registered
proprietor:
i. for the purpose of sale to apply or cause to be
applied, to any article in any class of articles in
which the design is registered, the design or any
fraudulent or obvious imitation thereof, or to do
anything with a view to enable the design to be
so applied;
ii. to import such article for the purposes of sale;
iii. to publish or expose or cause to be published
or exposed for sale, that article.


Appeal

passed by the Controller under the following
provisions:
i. an order under Section 5, refusing registration
of a design; ii. an order under Section 19, passed
in a cancellation petition; iii. an order under
Section 31, passed in a rectification petition; iv.
an order under Section 35, refusing registration
on the ground of public order or morality.

of the date of the order of the Controller.
The date of such order is the date on which the
order is dispatched.

INTRODUCTION
Legal metrology is the application of legal
requirements to measurements and measuring
instruments. Very often, small errors in either
direction average out over a large number of
measurements. But biased errors can create
considerable financial prejudice and can have
serious economic consequences for the end
consumer.
Legal Metrology is the name by which the law
relating to weights and measures is known in
international parlance. Legal Metrology is very
vital for scientific, technological and industrial
progress of any country. The establishment of
national standards of weights and measures and
their proper enforcement aim at ensuring
accuracy of measurements and measuring
instruments and thus legal metrology
strengthens the national economy in a broader
sense besides being a potential instrument of
consumer protection. The scope of legal
metrology according to international practice
extends to three broad fields of human activities,
namely, commercial transactions, industrial
measurements and measurements needed to
ensure public health and human safety. The
coverage of legal metrology varies from country
to country. In some, almost all practical
measurements are brought under the purview of
legal metrology, whereas in other countries legal
metrology finds restricted application in a few
quantities like mass, length and volume used in
trade and commerce. In most of the countries,
however, legal metrology encompasses
measurements which have a bearing on the
protection of individuals from the financial and
environmental points of view.
Legal metrology can be defined as that part of
metrology which deals with units of
measurement, methods of measurement and
measuring instruments in so far as they concern
statutory, technical and legal requirements which
have the ultimate object of assuring public
guarantee from the point of view of security and
of appropriate accuracy of measurements.
International Organization of Legal Metrology
(OIML)
The International Organization of Legal
Metrology (OIML) is an intergovernmental treaty
organization whose membership includes
Member States, countries which participate
actively in technical activities, and
Corresponding Members, countries which join
the OIML as observers. It was established in
1955 in order to promote the global
harmonization of legal metrology procedures.
Since that time, the OIML has developed a
worldwide technical structure that provides its
Members with metrological guidelines for the
elaboration of national and regional
requirements concerning the manufacture and
use of measuring instruments for legal metrology
applications.
According to OIML, Legal Metrology is the
entirety of the legislative, administrative and
technical procedures established by, or by
reference to public authorities, and implemented
on their behalf in order to specify and to ensure,
in a regulatory or contractual manner, the
appropriate quality and credibility of
measurements related to official controls, trade,
health, safety and the environment.
The OIML develops model regulations,
International Recommendations, which provide
Members with an internationally agreed-upon
basis for the establishment of national legislation
on various categories of measuring instruments.
Given the increasing national implementation of
OIML guidelines, more and more manufacturers
are referring to OIML International
Recommendations to ensure that their products
meet international specifications for metrological
performance and testing.
The International Organization of Legal
Metrology is an intergovernmental treaty
organization which:
* develops model regulations, standards and
related documents for use by legal metrology
authorities and industry;
* provides mutual recognition systems which
reduce trade barriers and costs in a global
market; ? represents the interests of the legal
metrology community within international
organizations and forums concerned with
metrology, standardization, testing, certification
and accreditation;
* promotes and facilitates the exchange of
knowledge and competencies within the legal
metrology community worldwide;
* cooperates with other metrology bodies to raise
awareness of the contribution that a sound legal
metrology infrastructure can make to a modern
economy.
OIML Certificate System for Measuring
Instruments
The OIML Certificate System for Measuring
Instruments was introduced in 1991 to facilitate
administrative procedures and lower the costs
associated with the international trade of
measuring instruments subject to legal
requirements. The System provides the
possibility for a manufacturer to obtain an OIML
Certificate and a Test Report indicating that a
given instrument type (pattern) complies with the
requirements of the relevant OIML International
Recommendations. Certificates are delivered by
OIML Member States that have established one
or several Issuing Authorities responsible for
processing applications by manufacturers
wishing to have their instrument types (patterns)
certified.
Certificates issued by OIML are accepted by
national metrology services on a voluntary basis,
and as the climate for mutual confidence and
recognition of test results develops between
OIML Members, the System serves to simplify
the type (pattern) approval process for
manufacturers and metrology authorities by
eliminating costly duplication of application and
test procedures.
The objectives of the OIML Certification System
are:
(a) to promote the global harmonization, uniform
interpretation and implementation of legal
metrological requirements for measuring
instruments and/or modules;
(b) to avoid unnecessary re-testing when
obtaining national type evaluations and
approvals, and to support the recognition of
measuring instruments and/or modules under
legal metrological control, while achieving and
maintaining confidence in the results in support
of facilitating the global trade of individual
instruments; and
(c) to establish rules and procedures for
fostering mutual confidence among participating
OIML Member States and Corresponding
Members in the results of type evaluations that
indicate conformity of measuring instruments
and/or modules, under legal metrological control,
to the metrological and technical requirements
established in the applicable OIML
Recommendation(s).

protection, shall, before putting such weight or
measure into such use, have such weight or
measure verified at such place and during such
hours as the Controller may, by general or
special order, specify in this behalf, on payment
of such fees as may be prescribed.
The Central Government may prescribe the
kinds of weights and measures for which the
verification is to be done through the
Government approved Test Centre. The
Government approved Test Centre shall be
notified by the Central Government or the State

THE ESSENTIAL COMMODITIES ACT, 1955
The Essential Commodities Act, 1955 was
enacted to regulate the production, supply and
distribution of, and trade and commerce in,
certain commodities which are declared as
essential commodities and specified in the
Schedule to that Act.
Schedule to the Act lists out following
commodities: (1) drugs: The explanation clarifies
that for the purposes of this Schedule, "drugs"
has the meaning assigned to it in clause (b) of
Section 3 of the Drugs and Cosmetics Act, 1940;
(2) fertilizer, whether inorganic, organic or mixed;
(3) foodstuffs, including edible oilseeds and oils;
(4) hank yarn made wholly from cotton; (5)
petroleum and petroleum products; (6) raw jute
and jute textiles; (7) (i) seeds of food-crops and
seeds of fruits and vegetables; (ii) seeds of
cattle fodder; and (iii) jute seeds.
The Essential Commodities Act, 1955 was
enacted to ensure easy availability of essential
commodities to the consumers and to protect
them from exploitation by unscrupulous traders.
The Act provides for regulation and control of
production, distribution and pricing of
commodities, which are declared as essential for
maintaining or increasing supplies or for securing
their equitable distribution and availability at fair
prices. The Essential Commodities Act is being
implemented by the State Governments/UT
Administrations by availing of the delegated
powers under the Act. The State Governments/
UT Administrations have issued various Control
Orders for regulation, production and distribution
of Essential Commodities such as food grains,
edible oils, pulses kerosene, sugar etc. The
Central Government regularly monitors the
action taken by State Governments/ UT
Administrations to implement the provisions of
the Essential Commodities Act, 1955. The items
declared as essential commodities under the
Essential Commodities Act, 1955 are reviewed
from time to time in the light of liberalized
economic policies in consultation with the
Ministries/ Departments administering the
essential commodities and particularly with
regard to their production, demand, and supply.
The Preamble to the Act says that it is an Act to
provide in the interest of the general public for
the control of the production, supply and
distribution of, and trade and commerce in,
certain commodities. The dominant object and
intendment of the Act is to secure equitable
distribution and availability at fair prices of
essential commodities in the interest of the
general public. The interest of the general public
necessarily connotes the interest of the
consuming public and not the interest of the
dealer (1958 Andh. LT587).
The Central Government having been vested
with power under Section 3 can issue order in
the following circumstances providing for
regulating or prohibiting the production, supply
and distribution of essential commodities and
trade and commerce therein: (i) when it is
necessary or expedient for maintaining or
increasing supplies of any essential commodity;
(ii) for securing the equitable distribution and
availability of essential commodities at fair price;
or (iii) for securing any essential commodity for
the defence of India or the efficient conduct of
military operations.
The Essential Commodities Act, 1955 envisages
two independent proceedings against a person
charged with contravention of the provisions of
the Act. Under the Act, the Collector can
confiscate the seized commodity. Confiscation of
essential commodities is a sharp weapon which
the Act has provided to the Central Government
under of the Act. Any person aggrieved by an
order of confiscation may appeal to the State
Government.
The Act declares that notwithstanding anything
contained in the Criminal Procedure Code, 1971,
every offence punishable under the Act shall be
cognizable. A cognizable offence is one, where,
under the Criminal Procedure Code or any other
law in force, a police officer may arrest a person
without a warrant. Court can take cognizance of
any offence punishable under the Act, the
following three conditions must be satisfied, viz.
(i) there must be a report in writing, (ii) the report
must be made by a public servant, as defined in
Section 21 of Indian Penal Code, or any
aggrieved person or any recognised consumer
association.
The Act provides that if the person contravening
an order under Section 3 is, a company, every
person who, at the time of the contravention,
was in charge of, and was responsible to, the
company for the conduct of the business of the
company, shall be deemed to be guilty of the
contravention, and shall be liable to be punished
accordingly. In such cases, the company itself is
also liable to be proceeded against. Any such
person, can, however, escape liability if he
proves that the contravention took place without
his knowledge or that he exercised all due
diligence to prevent it. It may be noted that the
term 'company' as used above, refers to
anybody corporate, and even includes a firm or
other association or individuals. In the case of a
firm, the term 'Director' would mean a partner in
the firm.

INTRODUCTION
Real estate sector plays a catalytic role in
fulfilling the needs and demand for housing and
infrastructure in the country and is an important
pillar of the economy. While this sector has
grown significantly in recent years, it has been
largely unregulated, with absence of
professionalism and standardisation and lack of
adequate consumer protection. It has no sectoral
regulator like there are for other specific sectors
like insurance, telecom, stock markets etc.
History is witness to the fact that whenever
sectoral regulators like SEBI, IRDAI, TRAI etc
have been formed, they have helped in
deepening the market and made it more robust.
Though the Consumer Protection Act, 1986 is
available as a forum to the buyers in the real
estate market, the recourse is only curative and
is not adequate to address all the concerns of
buyers and promoters in that sector. The lack of
standardisation has been a constraint to the
healthy and orderly growth of industry.
Therefore, since more than a decade the need
for regulating the sector was being emphasised
in various forums.
In view of the above, Parliament enacted the
Real Estate (Regulation and Development) Act,
2016 which aims at protecting the rights and
interests of consumers and promotion of
uniformity and standardization of business
practices and transactions in the real estate
sector. It attempts to balance the interests of
consumers and promoters by imposing certain
responsibilities on both. It seeks to establish
symmetry of information between the promoter
and purchaser, transparency of contractual
conditions, set minimum standards of
accountability and a fast-track dispute resolution
mechanism.
This Act will be put in operation just like the
Motor Vehicles Act passed by the Central
Government, pursuant to which respective State
Governments ("SG") and Union Territories ('UT")
are required to notify their own Rules, which
would be in the lines of the Central Act and
accordingly administer their own State Rules.
Accordingly, every SG and UT are to required to
promulgate their own Real Estate Rules which
would be based on the lines of the central Real
Estate (Regulation and Development) Act 2016,
and establish a Real Estate Regulatory Authority
("RERA") pursuant to the Rules, which will
administer the respective Real Estate Rules of
the State or UT.
Importance of a house in a developing country
like India can be gauged from the data which
shows that about more than 77% of total assets
of an average Indian household are held in real
estate and it's the single largest investment of an
individual in his lifetime. The real estate in India
has a peculiar feature. The buyer borrows
money to pay for a house and simultaneously
plays the role of a financer as building projects
collect money upfront and this puts the buyer in a
very vulnerable position-the weakest stakeholder
with a high financial exposure. The amendment
to the Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code, 2018
recognized the home buyers as financial
creditors.

In the case of M/s. Newtech Promoters and
Developers Pvt. Ltd. vs. State of UP & Ors. Etc,
Civil Appeal No(s). 6745-6749 of 2021 (Arising
out of SLP (Civil) No(s). 3711-3715 of 2021)
judgement dated 11th November, 2021 Supreme
Court of India inter-alia observed that:
It was introduced with an object to ensure
greater accountability towards consumers, to
significantly reduce frauds & delays and also the
current high transaction costs, and to balance
the interests of consumers and promoters by
imposing certain responsibilities on both, and to
bring transparency of the contractual conditions,
set minimum standards of accountability and a
fast track dispute resolution mechanism. It also
proposes to induct professionalism and
standardization in the sector, thus paving the
way for accelerated growth and investments in
the long run.
To meet out different nature of exigencies, it was
noticed by the Parliament that Pan India, large
number of real estate projects where the
allottees did not get possession for years
together and complaints being filed before
different forums including under the Consumer
Protection Act has failed to deliver adequate/
satisfactory results to the consumer/allottees and
their life savings is locked in and sizable sections
of allottees had invested their hardearned
money, money obtained through loans or
financial institutions with the belief that they will
be able to get a roof in the form of their
apartments/flats/unit.
At the given time, there was no law regulating
the real estate sector, development
works/obligations of promoter and allottee, it was
badly felt that such of the ongoing projects to
which completion certificate has not been issued
must be brought within the fold of the Act 2016 in
securing the interests of allottees, promoters,
real estate agents in its best possible way
obviously, within the parameters of law. Merely
because enactment as prayed is made
retroactive in its operation, it cannot be said to
be either violative of Articles 14 or 19(1)(g) of the
Constitution of India. To the contrary, the
Parliament indeed has the power to legislate
even retrospectively to take into its fold the pre-
existing contract and rights executed between
the parties in the larger public interest.

REgISTRATION OF REAL ESTATE PROJECT
AND REgISTRATION OF REAL ESTATE
AgENTS
Many developers across India follow a common
practice of pre-lauching a project without
securing requisite approvals for the project from
the local authorities, which is termed as "soft
launch", "pre-launch" etc. Buyers also gets
tapped into this opportunity as they get
discounted prices during the pre-launches
period. But if it is from a developer who is
unscrupulous or a fly by night operator, then it
carries a great risk. Hence, to plug this gap,
registration of every project with the regulatory
authority has been made mandatory before it is
launched for sale and for registration, the basic
pre-requisite is that the developer must have all
the requisite approvals. Thus, the buyer is
protected as the project is ring-fenced from the
vagaries of non-approvals or delays in approvals
which are one of the major causes of delay for
the project.
Prior Registration of Real Estate project with
Real Estate Regulatory Authority (Section 3)
A promoter shall not advertise, market, book, sell
or offer for sale, or invite persons to purchase in
any manner any plot, apartment or building, as
the case may be, in any real estate project or

registering the real estate project with the Real
Estate Regulatory Authority established under
section 20 of the Act.

constructed an independent building or a
building consisting of apartments, or converts an
existing building or a part thereof into
apartments, for the purpose of selling all or some
of the apartments to other persons and includes
his assignees; or
(ii) a person who develops land into a project,
whether or not the person also constructs
structures on any of the plots, for the purpose of
selling to other persons all or some of the plots in
the said project, whether with or without
structures thereon; or
(iii) any development authority or any other
public body in respect of allottees of-
(a) buildings or apartments, as the case may be,
constructed by such authority or body on lands
owned by them or placed at their disposal by the

building or apartment for sale to the general

both of them shall be deemed to be the
promoters and shall be jointly liable as such for
the functions and responsibilities specified, under
this Act or the rules and regulations made there
under. {Section 2(zk)}
The very purpose and object of enacting the Act,
2016 was to safeguard the interest of the home
buyers from the project which was launched by
the promoter and was not completed in time.
The legislature does not leave any individual,
association, or organization as an exception to
the word 'promoter'. The use of the word 'a
person' at the outset of the definition clause of
the word 'promoter' clearly signifies that it
embraces all types of individuals, associations,
corporations, and authorities dealing in the real
estate sector and does not exclude any
organization though it may be "no profit no loss"
organization but is registered under the Act. (Air
Force Naval Housing Board Air Force Station vs.
U.P. RERA and others)
Real estate project means the development of a
building or a building consisting of apartments, or
converting an existing building or a part thereof
into apartments, or the development of land into
plots or apartment, as the case may be, for the
purpose of selling all or some of the said
apartments or plots or building, as the case may
be, and includes the common areas, the
development works, all improvements and
structures thereon, and all easement, rights and
appurtenances belonging thereto. {Section 2(zn)}

commencement of this Act and for which the
completion certificate has not been issued, the

Authority for registration of the said project within
a period of three months from the date of
commencement of this Act.
Authority in the interest of allottees, for projects
which are developed beyond the planning area
but with the requisite permission of the local
authority, it may, by order, direct the promoter of
such project to register with the Authority, and
the provisions of this Act or the rules and
regulations made there under, shall apply to
such projects from that stage of registration
where the real estate project is to be developed
in phases, every such phase shall be considered
a stand alone real estate project, and the
promoter shall obtain registration under this Act
for each phase separately.
Projects exempt from the ambit of the Act
The following projects do not require to be
registered under the Act:
(a) area of land proposed to be developed does
not exceed 500 Sq. Meters or No. of apartments
proposed to be developed does not exceed eight
inclusive of all phases:
Provided that, if the appropriate Government
considers it necessary, it may, reduce the
threshold below five hundred square meters or
eight apartments, as the case may be, inclusive
of all phases, for exemption from registration
under this Act;
(b) where the promoter has received completion
certificate for a real estate project prior to
commencement of this Act;
(c) for the purpose of renovation or repair or re-
development which does not involve marketing,
advertising selling or new allotment of any
apartment, plot or building, as the case may be,

Developers Pvt. Ltd. Vs. State of UP & Ors. etc,
Civil Appeal No(s). 6745-6749 of 2021 [Arising
out of SLP (Civil) No(s). 3711-3715 of 2021]
Supreme Court of India inter- alia observed that
from the scheme of the Act 2016, its application
is retroactive in character and it can safely be
observed that the projects already completed or
to which the completion certificate has been
granted are not under its fold and therefore,
vested or accrued rights, if any, in no manner are
affected. At the same time, it will apply after
getting the ongoing projects and future projects
registered under Section 3 to prospectively
follow the mandate of the Act 2016.

Delay in handing over of projects by the
developer within the stipulated time frame has
been a major woe of the buyers and hence has
been a major trigger for promulgation of this Act.
Hence, at the time of registration, a developer
has to specify a time line during which he will
complete and handover the project to the buyer.
The timeline is very sacrosanct because if he
fails to do so within the stated time, then there
are rigorous provisions in the Act as prescribed
in section 7 & 8 whereby his registration would
be revoked and his project would be usurped by
the Regulator. Though as per section 6, an
extension of registration may be granted at the
sole discretion of the Regulator due to Force
Majeure conditions or if there are reasonable
circumstances which merit extension.
The registration granted may be extended by the
Authority on an application made by the
promoter due to force majeure, in such form and
on payment of such fee as may be specified by
regulations made by the Authority.
Force majeure shall mean a case of war, flood,
drought, fire, cyclone, earthquake or any other
calamity caused by nature affecting the regular
development of the real estate project.
The Authority may in reasonable circumstances,
without default on the part of the promoter,
based on the facts of each case, and for reasons
to be recorded in writing, extend the registration
granted to a project for such time as it considers
necessary, which shall, in aggregate, not exceed
a period of one year.
Application for extension of registration shall not
be rejected unless the applicant has been given
an opportunity of being heard in the matter.

Revocation of Registration (Section 7)
The Authority may, on receipt of a complaint or
suo moto in this behalf or on the
recommendation of the competent authority,
revoke the registration granted, after being
satisfied that-
(a) the promoter makes default in doing anything
required by or under this Act or the rules or the
regulations made there under;
                                                                        the promoter is

Real estate broking is one of the easiest
business in India as there are no specific
qualification or experience requirements and

accountability, transparency and professional
benchmarks. Hence, there are thousands of
non-professional agents/ brokers in every city
operating without any accountability. Hence, to

have also been covered under the ambit of
RERA and registration requirement has been
mandatory for them as per section 9 of the Act.

shall not facilitate the sale or purchase of or act
on behalf of any person to facilitate the sale or
purchase of any plot, apartment or building, as
the case may be, in a real estate project or part
of it, being the part of the real estate project
registered, being sold by the promoter in any
planning area.
Every real estate agent shall make an
application to the Authority for registration in
such form, manner, within such time and
accompanied by such fee and documents as
may be prescribed.
The Authority shall, within such period, in such
manner and upon satisfying itself of the fulfilment
of such conditions, as may be prescribed-

agent for the entire State of Union territory, as
the case may be;
(b) reject the application for reasons to be
recorded in writing, if such application does not
conform to the provisions of the Act or the rules
or regulations made there under.
Application shall not be rejected unless the
applicant has been given an opportunity of being
heard in the matter.
Whereon the completion of the period prescribed
under the Act, if the applicant does not receive
any communication about the deficiencies in his
application or the rejection of his application, he
shall be deemed to have been registered.
Every real estate agent who is registered as per
the provisions of this Act or the rules and
regulations made there under, shall be granted a
registration number by the Authority, which shall
be quoted by the real estate agent in every sale
facilitated by him under this Act.
Every registration shall be valid for such period
as may be prescribed, and shall be renewable
for a period in such manner and on payment of
such fee as may be prescribed.
Where any real estate agent who has been
granted registration under this Act commits
breach of any of the conditions thereof or any
other terms and conditions specified under this
Act or any rules or regulations made there under,
or where the Authority is satisfied that such
registration has been secured by the real estate
agent through misrepresentation or fraud, the
Authority may, without prejudice to any other
provisions under this Act, revoke the registration
or suspend the same for such period as it thinks
fit:
Provided that no such revocation or suspension
shall be made by the Authority unless an
opportunity of being heard has been given to the
real estate agent.
Functions of Real Estate Agents (Section 10)
Every real estate agent which is not registered
with the Authority shall not facilitate the sale or

Return of Amount and Compensation (Section
18)
Section 18(1) provides that f the promoter fails to
complete or is unable to give possession of an
apartment, plot or building,-
(a) in accordance with the terms of the
agreement for sale or, as the case may be, duly
completed by the date specified therein; or
(b) due to discontinuance of his business as a
developer on account of suspension or
revocation of the registration under this Act or for
any other reason,
he shall be liable on demand to the allottees, in
case the allottee wishes to withdraw from the
project, without prejudice to any other remedy
available, to return the amount received by him
in respect of that apartment, plot, building, as the
case may be, with interest at such rate as may
be prescribed in this behalf including
compensation in the manner as provided under
this Act.
Provided that where an allottee does not intend
to withdraw from the project, he shall be paid, by
the promoter, interest for every month of delay,
till the handing over of the possession, at such
rate as may be prescribed.
The promoter shall compensate the allottees in
case of any loss caused to him due to defective
title of the land, on which the project is being
developed or has been developed, in the manner
as provided under this Act, and the claim for
compensation under this subsection shall not be
barred by limitation provided under any law for
the time being in force.
If the promoter fails to discharge any other
obligations imposed on him under this Act or the
rules or regulations made thereunder or in
accordance with the terms and conditions of the
agreement for sale, he shall be liable to pay
such compensation to the allottees, in the
manner as provided under this Act.
The Hon'ble Supreme Court of India while
interpreting Section 18 of the Act, in the case of
Imperia Structures Ltd. Vs. Anil Patni and
Another [2020(10) SCC 783 ] held that in terms
of Section 18 of the RERA Act, if a promoter fails
to complete or is unable to give possession of an
apartment duly completed by the date specified
in the agreement, the promoter would be liable,
on demand, to return the amount received by
him in respect of that apartment if the allottee
wishes to withdraw from the Project. Such right
of an allottee is specifically made "without
prejudice to any other remedy available to him".
The right so given to the allottee is unqualified
and if availed, the money deposited by the
allottee has to be refunded with interest at such
rate as may be prescribed. The proviso to
Section 18(1) contemplates a situation where the
allottee does not intend to withdraw from the
Project. In that case he is entitled to and must be
paid interest for every month of delay till the
handing over of the possession. It is up to the
allottee to proceed either under Section 18(1) or
under proviso to Section 18(1). The case of
Himanshu Giri came under the latter category.
The RERA Act thus definitely provides a remedy
to an allottee who wishes to withdraw from the
Project or claim return on his investment."

THE REAL ESTATE REgULATORY
AUTHORITY
As stated earlier, though this sector has seen

two years from the date of the order made under
the Act, with a view to rectifying any mistake
apparent from the record, amend any order
passed by it, and shall make such amendment, if
the mistake is brought to its notice by the parties.
It may be noted that no such amendment shall
be made in respect of any order against which
an appeal has been preferred under the Act:
Recovery of Interest or Penalty or Compensation
and Enforcement of Order, etc. (Section 40)
Section 40(1) states that if a promoter or an
allottee or a real estate agent, as the case may
be, fails to pay any interest or penalty or
compensation imposed on him, by the
adjudicating officer or the Regulatory Authority or
the Appellate Authority, as the case may be,
under this Act or the rules and regulations made
thereunder, it shall be recoverable from such

Appellate Tribunal, as the case may be, issues
any order or directs any person to do any act, or
refrain from doing any act, which it is empowered
to do under this Act or the rules or regulations
made thereunder, then in case of failure by any
person to comply with such order or direction,
the same shall be enforced, in such manner as
may be prescribed.
Whether the authority has the power to issue
recovery certificates for recovery of the principal
amount under Section 40(1) of the Act?
In the case of M/s. Newtech Promoters and
Developers Pvt. Ltd. Vs. State of UP & Ors. Etc,
Civil Appeal No(s). 6745-6749 of 2021 (Arising
out of SLP(Civil) No(s). 3711-3715 OF 2021)
judgement dated 11th November, 2021,
Supreme Court of India held that:
It is settled principle of law that if the plain
interpretation does not fulfil the mandate and
object of the Act, this Court has to interpret the
law in consonance with the spirit and purpose of
the statute. There is indeed a visible
inconsistency in the powers of the authority
regarding refund of the amount received by the
promoter and the provision of law in Section 18
and the text of the provision by which such
refund can be referred under Section 40(1).
While harmonising the construction of the
scheme of the Act with the right of recovery as
mandated in Section 40(1) of the Act keeping in
mind the intention of the legislature to provide for
a speedy recovery of the amount invested by the
allottee along with the interest incurred thereon
is self-explanatory. However, if Section 40(1) is
strictly construed and it is understood to mean
that only penalty and interest on the principal
amount are recoverable as arrears of land
revenue, it would defeat the basic purpose of the
Act.
Taking into consideration the scheme of the Act
what is to be returned to the allottee is his own
life savings with interest on computed/quantified
by the authority becomes recoverable and such
arrear becomes enforceable in law. There
appears some ambiguity in Section 40(1) of the
Act that in our view, by harmonising the
provision with the purpose of the Act, is given
effect to the provisions is allowed to operate
rather running either of them redundant, noticing
purport of the legislature and the above stated
principle into consideration, we make it clear that
the amount which has been determined and
refundable to the allottees/home buyers either
by the authority or the adjudicating officer in
terms of the order is recoverable within the ambit
of Section 40(1) of the Act.

43(5) provided condition of pre- deposit being
complied with can be further challenged in
appeal before the High Court under Section 58
of the Act and, thus, the legislature has put
reasonable restriction and safeguards at all
stages. In our considered view, the obligation
cast upon the promoter of predeposit under
Section 43(5) of the Act, being a class in itself,
and the promoters who are in receipt of money
which is being claimed by the home
buyers/allottees for refund and determined in the
first place by the competent authority, if
legislature in its wisdom intended to ensure that
money once determined by the authority be
saved if appeal is to be preferred at the instance
of the promoter after due compliance of
predeposit as envisaged under Section 43(5) of
the Act, in no circumstance can be said to be
onerous as prayed for or in violation of Articles
14 or 19(1)(g) of the Constitution of India.

ROLE OF COMPANY SECRETARIES

India is witnessing a phenomenal growth and
expansion in the corporate sector. The growing
demand for specialists in almost every sphere of
the corporate functions has led to emergence of
professionals who can perform specialized skills
with near perfection in their respective fields. A
company secretary is one such professional who
is responsible for efficient management of the
corporate sector. He ensures compliance of
various company legislations and advises
directors on statutory requirements of the
company. Apart from carrying out these
functions, he also looks after finance, accounts,
legal, secretarial, personnel and administrative
functions in private as well as public sectors.
The Companies Act, 2013 confers a special
status to Company Secretary as the key
managerial personnel and has bracketed him
along with Managing Director (MD) or Chief
Executive Officer (CEO) or Manager, Whole-
time director(s) or Chief Financial Officer (CFO).
Every listed company and every other public
company having a paid up share capital of ten
crore rupees or more has to appoint a whole time
Key Managerial Personnel. Every private
company which has a paid up share capital of
ten crore rupees or more shall have a whole -
time company secretary.
Almost every kind of organization whose affairs
are conducted by boards, councils or other
corporate structures, be it a company, trust,
association, federation, authority, commission or
the like find it useful to appoint a person who
holds the qualification of Company Secretaryship
in key administrative position. Practising

recognized to appear before various Tribunals
such as NCLT, NCLAT, Securities Appellate
Tribunal, Competition Commission of India,
Telecom Disputes Settlement and Appellate
Tribunal, Consumer Forums, Tax Tribunals etc.

Practising Company Secretaries to undertake
Diligence Report for Banks.

The rapid change in Indian Legislative has
brought about a sea change in the role and
profile of a company secretary. They are now
being seen as corporate development planners.
Besides embarking upon traditional areas of
practice, Company Secretaries in Practice are
increasingly required to advise and guide on
legal aspects of business which intimately
concern areas such as registration under RERA,
production, drafting of various documents, sales,
marketing and administration for identifying
expansion opportunities, issuing due diligence or
compliance certificate, arranging foreign
collaborations, amalgamations, mergers,
acquisition, takeovers, setting up of subsidiaries
and joint ventures within and outside India etc.

greatly contributed to the development of the
practice side of the profession.

Compounding of offences (Section 70)
Notwithstanding anything contained in the Code
of Criminal Procedure, 1973, if any person is
punished with imprisonment under the Act, the
punishment may, either before or after the
institution of the prosecution, be compounded by
the court on such terms and conditions and on
payment of such sums as may be prescribed.
However the sum prescribed shall not, in any
case, exceed the maximum amount of the fine
which may be imposed for the offence so
compounded.
Power to adjudicate (Section 71)
For the purpose of adjudging compensation
under sections 12, 14, 18 and section 19
(Section 12 deals with obligations of promoter
regarding veracity of the advertisement or
prospectus, Section 14 deals with Adherence to
sanctioned plans and project specifications by
the promoter, Section 18 deals with Return of
amount and compensation, Section 19 deals
with Rights and duties of allottees), the Authority
shall appoint in consultation with the appropriate
Government one or more judicial officer as
deemed necessary, who is or has been a District
Judge to be an adjudicating officer for holding an
inquiry in the prescribed manner, after giving any
person concerned a reasonable opportunity of
being heard.
Any person whose complaint in respect of
matters covered under section(s) 12, 14, 18 and
section 19 is pending before the Consumer
Disputes Redressal Forum or the Consumer
Disputes Redressal Commission or the National
Consumer Redressal Commission, established
under section 9 of the Consumer Protection Act,
1986, on or before the commencement of the
Act, he may, with the permission of such Forum
or Commission, as the case may be, withdraw
the complaint pending before it and file an
application before the adjudicating officer under
this Act.
The application for adjudging compensation shall
be dealt with by the adjudicating officer as
expeditiously as possible and dispose of the
same within a period of sixty days from the date
of receipt of the application. Where any such
application could not be disposed of within the
said period of sixty days, the adjudicating officer
shall record his reasons in writing for not
disposing of the application within that period.
While holding an inquiry the adjudicating officer
shall have power to summon and enforce the
attendance of any person acquainted with the
facts and circumstances of the case to give
evidence or to produce any document which in
the opinion of the adjudicating officer, may be
useful for or relevant to the subject matter of the
inquiry and if, on such inquiry, he is satisfied that
the person has failed to comply with the
provisions of any of the sections i.e., sections 12,
14, 18 and section 19, he may direct to pay such
compensation or interest, as the case any be, as
he thinks fit in accordance with the provisions of
any of those sections.
Whether the authority has jurisdiction to direct
return/refund of the amount to the allottee under
Sections 12, 14, 18 and 19 of the Act or the
jurisdiction exclusively lies with the adjudicating
officer under Section 71 of the Act?
In the case of M/s. Newtech Promoters and
Developers Pvt. Ltd. Vs. State of UP & Ors. Etc,
Civil Appeal No(S). 6745 6749 of 2021 (Arising
out of SLP (Civil) No(s). 37113715 OF 2021)
judgement dated 11th November, 2021 Supreme
Court of India held that:
The legislature in its wisdom has made a specific
provision delineating power to be exercised by
the regulatory authority/adjudicating officer.
Refund of the amount" and "compensation" are
two distinct components which the allottee or the
person aggrieved is entitled to claim if the
promoter has not been able to hand over
possession with a nature of enquiry and
mechanism provided under the Act. So far as the
claim with respect to refund of amount on
demand under Sections 18(1) and 19(4) of the
Act is concerned, it vests within the jurisdiction of
the regulatory authority. Section 71 carves out
the jurisdiction of the adjudicating officer to
adjudge compensation under Sections 12, 14, 18
and 19 after holding enquiry under Section 71(3)
of the Act keeping in view the broad contours
referred to under Section 72 of the Act.
From the scheme of the Act of which a detailed
reference has been made and taking note of
power of adjudication delineated with the
regulatory authority and adjudicating officer,
what finally culls out is that although the Act
indicates the distinct expressions like 'refund',
'interest', 'penalty' and 'compensation', a conjoint
reading of Sections 18 and 19 clearly manifests
that when it comes to refund of the amount, and
interest on the refund amount, or directing
payment of interest for delayed delivery of
possession, or penalty and interest thereon, it is
the regulatory authority which has the power to
examine and determine the outcome of a
complaint. At the same time, when it comes to a
question of seeking the relief of adjudging
compensation and interest thereon under
Sections 12, 14, 18 and 19, the adjudicating
officer exclusively has the power to determine,
keeping in view the collective reading of Section
71 read with Section 72 of the Act. If the
adjudication under Sections 12, 14, 18 and 19
other than compensation as envisaged, if
extended to the adjudicating officer as prayed
that, in our view, may intend to expand the ambit
and scope of the powers and functions of the
adjudicating officer under Section 71 and that
would be against the mandate of the Act 2016."
Factors to be taken into account by the
adjudicating officer (Section 72)
While adjudging the quantum of compensation or
interest, as the case may be, under section 71,
the adjudicating officer shall have due regard to
the following factors, namely:- (a) the amount of
disproportionate gain or unfair advantage,
wherever quantifiable, made as a result of the
default; (b) the amount of loss caused as a result
of the default; (c) the repetitive nature of the
default; (d) such other factors which the
adjudicating officer considers necessary to the
case in furtherance of justice.
MISCELLANEOUS
bar of Jurisdiction (Section 79)
No civil court shall have jurisdiction to entertain
any suit or proceeding in respect of any matter
which the Authority or the Adjudicating officer or
the Appellate Tribunal is empowered by or under
the Act to determine and no injunction shall be
granted by any court or other authority in respect
of any action taken or to be taken in pursuance
of any power conferred by or under the Act.
Cognizance of Offences (Section 80)
No court shall take cognizance of any offence
punishable under this Act or the rules or
regulations made thereunder save on a
complaint in writing made by the Authority or by
any officer of the Authority duly authorised by it
for this purpose.
No court inferior to that of a Metropolitan
Magistrate or a Judicial Magistrate of the first
class shall try any offence punishable under this
Act.
Delegation (Section 81)
The Authority may, by general or special order in
writing, delegate to any member, officer of the
Authority or any other person subject to such
conditions, if any, as may be specified in the
order, such of its powers and functions under this
Act (except the power to make regulations under
section 85), as it may deem necessary.
Whether Section 81 of the Act authorizes the
authority to delegate its powers to a single
member of the authority to hear complaints
instituted under Section 31 of the Act?
In the case of M/s. Newtech Promoters and
Developers Pvt. Ltd. Vs. State of UP & Ors. Etc.,
Civil Appeal No(S). 6745 6749 of 2021 (Arising
out of SLP(Civil) No(s). 3711-3715 of 2021)
judgement dated 11th November, 2021 Supreme
Court of India held that:
Section 81 of the Act 2016 empowers the
authority, by general or special order in writing,
to delegate its powers to any member of the
authority, subject to conditions as may be
specified in the order, such of the powers and
functions under the Act. What has been excluded
is the power to make regulations under Section
85, rest of the powers exercised by the authority
can always be delegated to any of its members
obviously for expeditious disposal of the
applications/complaints including complaints
filed under Section 31 of the Act and exercise of
such power by a general and special order to its
members is always permissible under the
provisions of the Act.
It is a well-established principle of interpretation
of law that the court should read the section in
literal sense and cannot rewrite it to suit its
convenience; nor does any canon of
construction permit the court to read the section
in such a manner as to render it to some extent
otiose. Section 81 of the Act positively
empowers the authority to delegate such of its
powers and functions to any member by a
general or a special order with an exception to
make regulations under Section 85 of the Act. As
a consequence, except the power to make
regulations under Section 85 of the Act, other
powers and functions of the authority, by a
general or special order, if delegated to a single
member of the authority is indeed within the fold
of Section 81 of the Act.
That scheme of the Act, 2016 provides an inbuilt
mechanism and any order passed on a
complaint by the authority under Section 31 is
appealable before the tribunal under Section
43(5) and further in appeal to the High Court
under Section 58 of the Act on one or more
ground specified under Section 100 of the Code
of Civil Procedure, 1908, if any manifest error is
left by the authority either in computation or in
the amount refundable to the allottee/home
buyer, is open to be considered at the appellate
stage on the complaint made by the person
aggrieved.
In view of the remedial mechanism provided
under the scheme of the Act 2016, in our
considered view, the power of delegation under
Section 81 of the Act by the authority to one of
its member for deciding applications/complaints
under Section 31 of the Act is not only well
defined but expressly permissible and that
cannot be said to be dehors the mandate of law.
Application of other laws not barred (Section 88)
The provisions of this Act shall be in addition to,
and not in derogation of, the provisions of any
other law for the time being in force.
Act to have overriding effect (Section 89)
The provisions of this Act shall have effect,
notwithstanding anything inconsistent therewith
contained in any other law for the time being in
force.
Protection of action taken in good faith (Section
90)
No suit, prosecution or other legal proceedings
shall lie against the appropriate Government or
the Authority or any officer of the appropriate
Government or any member, officer or other
employees of the Authority for anything which is
in good faith done or intended to be done under
this Act or the rules or regulations made
thereunder.
LESSON ROUND-UP
l On and from the coming into force of the RERA,
all real estate projects (as defined) would first
have to be registered with the real estate
regulatory authority, which, before registering
such projects, would look into all relevant details,
including delay in completion of other projects by
the developer.
l Importantly, the promoter is now to make a
declaration supported by an affidavit, that he
undertakes to complete the project within a
certain time period, and that 70% of the amounts
realised for the project from allottees, from time
to time, shall be deposited in a separate account,
which would be spent only to defray the cost of
construction and land cost for that particular
project.
l Registration is granted by the authority only
when it is satisfied that the promoter is a bona
fide promoter who is likely to perform his part of
the bargain satisfactorily.

l Registration of the project is only for a certain
period and can only be extended due to force
majeure events for a maximum period of one
year by the authority, on being satisfied that
such events have, in fact, taken place.
l Registration once granted, may be revoked if it
is found that the promoter defaults in complying
with the various statutory requirements or
indulges in unfair practices or irregularities.
Importantly, upon revocation of registration, the
authority is to facilitate the remaining
development work, which can then be carried out
either by the competent authority as defined by
the RERA or by the association of allottees or
otherwise.
l The promoter at the time of booking and issue
of allotment letters has to make available to the
allottees information, inter alia, as to the stage-
wise time schedule of completion of the project.
l Deposits or advances beyond 10% of the
estimated cost as advance payment cannot be
taken without first entering into an agreement for
sale. Importantly, the agreement for sale will
now no longer be a one-sided contract of
adhesion, but in such form as may be
prescribed, which balances the rights and
obligations of both the promoter and the
allottees.
l Under section 18, if the promoter fails to
complete or is unable to give possession of an
apartment, plot or building in accordance with
the terms of the agreement for sale, he must
return the amount received by him in respect of
such apartment etc. with such interest as may be
prescribed and must, in addition, the agreement
for sale. In addition, all allottees are to be
responsible for making necessary payments in
instalments within the time specified in the
agreement for sale and shall be liable to pay
interest at such rate as may be prescribed for
any delay in such payment.
l Under section 31, any aggrieved person may
file a complaint with the authority or the
adjudicating officers set up by such authority
against any promoter, allottee or real estate
agent, as the case may be, for violation or
contravention of the RERA, and rules and
regulations made thereunder.
l Also, if after adjudication a promoter, allottee or
real estate agent fails to pay interest, penalty or
compensation imposed on him by the authorities
under the RERA, the same shall be recoverable
as arrears of land revenue.
l Appeals may be filed to the real estate
appellate tribunal against decisions or orders of
the authority or the adjudicating officer. From
orders of the appellate tribunal, appeals may
thereafter be filed to the High Court. Stiff
penalties are to be awarded for breach and/or
contravention of the provisions of the RERA.
l Importantly, under section 72, the adjudicating
officer must first determine that the complainant
has established default on the part of the
respondent, after which consequential orders
may then follow. ? Under section 88, the
provisions of RERA are in addition to and not in
derogation of the provisions of any other law for
time being in force and under section 89, RERA
is to have effect notwithstanding anything
inconsistent contained in any other law for the
time being in force.

INTRODUCTION
As the term intellectual property relates to the
creations of human mind and human intellect,
this property is called Intellectual property.
Creators can be given the right to prevent others
from using their inventions, designs or other
creations and to use that right to negotiate
payment in return for others using them. These
are Intellectual Property Rights. The creation of
Intellectual Property Rights (IPR) is increasingly
being recognised in today's global economy and
society. Intellectual Property Rights are
considered to be the backbone of any economy
and their creation and protection is essential for
sustained growth of a nation. The intellectual
property rights are now not only being used as a
tool to protect the creativity and generate
revenue but also to build strategic alliances for
the socio-economic and technological growth.
Intellectual Property is the Property, which has
been created by exercise of Intellectual Faculty.
It is the result of persons Intellectual Activities.
Thus Intellectual Property refers to creation of
mind such as inventions, designs for industrial
articles, literary, artistic work, symbols which are
ultimately used in commerce. Intellectual
Property rights allow the creators or owners to
have the benefits from their works when these
are exploited commercially. These rights are
statutory rights governed in accordance with the
provisions of corresponding legislations.
Intellectual Property rights reward creativity &
human endeavor which fuel the progress of
humankind.
The areas of intellectual property that it covers
are: copyright and related rights (i.e. the rights of
performers, producers of sound recordings and
broadcasting organizations); trademarks
including service marks; geographical indications
including appellations of origin; industrial
designs; patents including the protection of new
varieties of plants; the layout-designs of
integrated circuits; and undisclosed information
including trade secrets and test data.
Intellectual property is a vital component of
economic growth and a tool for corporate
competitiveness in today's highly competitive
global market. Intellectual property rights serve
as a catalyst for the development of innovations
and inventions. Ideas, innovations, and creative
expressions on the basis of which there is a
public desire to grant the status of property are
referred to as intellectual property rights (IPR). In
order for the inventors or developers of that
property to profit commercially from their creative
efforts or reputation, IPR grant them specific
exclusive rights. There are various forms of
intellectual property protection, including
trademark, copyright, and patent.
Technology management is to promote the
effective and efficient use of created technology.
Intellectual property rights (IPR) are ideas,
inventions, and creative expressions on which
the public is ready to bestow the status of
property. It is increasingly important to manage
technology, including efficient commercialization
plans that take use of IPR benefits, in a dynamic
global context with shifting industry and
competitor landscapes.
Any original work of the human intellect,
including works of art, literature, technology, and
science, is considered to be a work of intellectual
property (IP). The legal privileges granted to the
inventor or creator to safeguard his invention or
creativity for a predetermined amount of time are
known as intellectual property rights (IPR). For a
specific amount of time, these legal rights grant
the inventor or creator's assignee the sole right
to fully exploit their idea or production. The
importance of IP in the contemporary economy
has long been established. Furthermore, it has
been unequivocally proven that the intellectual
work involved in the innovation must be given
the attention it deserves if the innovation is to
serve the greater good.
Since it gives the inventor or creator of an IP an
exclusive right to exploit his invention or product
for a specific length of time, IPR is a powerful
weapon for protecting investments in time,
money, and effort. By enabling healthy
competition, industrial progress, and economic
expansion, IPR thereby contributes to the
economic development of a nation.
Any society's progress is directly influenced by
IPR and the framework of its policy. Lack of
understanding of IPR led to the demise of
inventions, a high danger of infringement,
financial loss, and the end of a nation's
intellectual era. Therefore, there is a critical
necessity for the transmission of IPR knowledge
in order to support home-grown discoveries and
technological advancements. Only by teaching
the many stakeholders, including policymakers,
farmers, academia, industry, researchers, and
consumers about the significance of IPR and
technology management can the process of IP
awareness be accelerated in an agrarian nation
like India.
REgULATORY FRAMEWORK

NATURE OF INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY
* Intangible Rights over Tangible Property: IP's
intangibility is the primary characteristic that sets
it apart from other types of property. Although
there are many significant differences between
the various types of IP, one characteristic they all
share is the establishment of property protection
over intangible objects like ideas, inventions,
signs, and information as opposed to close
relationships and other intangible assets, which
are tangible objects. When works are exploited
for commercial purposes, it enables the creators
or owners to profit from their creations.
* Right to sue: IP is a resource that can be
owned and managed, to use the language of the
law. The majority of intellectual property is
challenged through legal rights of action that can
only be carried out by people who have legal
standing. Since intellectual property (IP) is a
property right, it can be inherited, purchased,
gifted, sold, licenced, entrusted, or pledged.
Subject to certain restrictions, the owner of an
IPR owns a sort of property that can be used
however they like. They also have the legal right
to sue anyone who uses their innovation without
their permission and to be compensated with
actual property.
* Rights and Duties: IP results in both obligations
and property rights. The owner of the IP is
entitled to carry out specific tasks in connection
with his creations. He has the sole authority to
create, copy, sell,
and otherwise exploit the work. Additionally,
there is a negative right that bars others from
using their statutory rights.
* Coexistence of different rights: In relation to a
specific function, various IPR kinds may coexist.
For instance, an image of an innovation might be
copyrighted and the invention itself might be
patented. A design may be included in a
trademark and may also be protected under the
Design Act. The numerous rights that can
coexist in IP share many similarities and
distinctions. For instance, there are similarities
between a patent and an industrial design, a
trademark and a geographical indicator, and so
forth. Some of the rights related to intellectual
property are positive rights, while the others are
negative rights.
* Exhaustion of rights: The doctrine of
exhaustion generally applies to intellectual
property rights. Exhaustion fundamentally means
that after the first sale made by the right holder
or by the authority designated for its exhaustion,
that person's right expires and he is no longer
permitted to halt the movement of the goods
moving forward. As a result, once an IP rights
holder has sold a physical good that bears IPRs,
it cannot stop subsequent sales of the good. The
first consent marks the end of the right. This
theory is founded on the idea of free movement
of products, which is legitimate by the owner's
permission or right. It is prohibited to use the
exclusive selling privilege in connection to the
same items twice.
* Dynamism: IPR is undergoing continual
improvement. The realm of IP is expanding as
quickly as technology in all spheres of human
activity. New things are being added to the IPR
scope and the scope of its protection is being
enlarged in accordance with the demands of
scientific and technical advancement.
Biopatents, Software Copyrights, and Plant
Diversity Protection are just a few examples of
terms that highlight recent advancements in the
IPR area. The value of intellectual property and
its portability has long been recognised, and it is
represented in all spheres of government,
including legislative, administrative, and judicial
levels.
NEED OF INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY
Every invention involves labour, time, and
resources. The length of each project varies
substantially. It could be anything from a few
seconds to a few years. A certain amount of
actual money is also necessary for any creative
endeavour, along with education or knowledge
of course. Any creative professional making all of
these investments is making a significant one.
Therefore, it is important to acknowledge and
honour a creator's intellectual works. The word
"intellectual property" did not become common
usage until the 19th century, despite the fact that
many of the legal rules governing intellectual
property rights have developed over centuries. It
wasn't until the latter half of the 20th century that
it spread throughout much of the world.
In 1967, the World Intellectual Property
Organization (WIPO) was founded as a UN
body. Since then, the phrase has gained
significant traction in the US. A comprehensive
international system for defining, safeguarding,
and upholding intellectual property rights exists.
It consists of multilateral treaty systems as well
as international organisations like the European
Union, World Trade Organization, World
Intellectual Property Organization, World
Customs Organization, and United Nations
Commission on International Trade Law
(UNCITRAL).
SCOPE OF INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY
The range of IP rights is wide, and there are two
methods for classifying IP as either copyright or
industrial property. Patents or inventions,
trademarks, trade names, biodiversity, plant
breeding rights, and other commercial interests
are all examples of industrial properties. In order
to profit from the invention, a patent gives its
holder the sole right to exploit the Intellectual
Property.
A novel creation, procedure, tool, or product is
considered to be an invention. Copyright protects
the expression of ideas that are distinct from
patents but does not grant you the sole right to
an idea. In addition to technological and
scientific works, copyright also applies to the arts
and literature. Copyright rules apply to
everything, including music and audiovisual
works. 60 years after the creator's passing,
copyright protection continues to be in effect. In
other words, a writer's book has copyright
protection both during his lifetime and for 60
years following his passing. In contrast to patent
laws, copyright laws do not mandate an
administrative procedure.
The general Agreement on Trade in Services
(gATS)
The General Agreement on Trade in Services
(GATS) is the first ever collection of legally
binding, multinational regulations governing
global trade in services. One of the most
important outcomes of the Uruguay Round,
whose conclusions came into effect in January
1995, was the founding of the GATS. The
General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade
(GATT), the GATS's counterpart in merchandise
trade, served as a model for it, sharing many of
the same goals: establishing a trustworthy and
reliable system of international trade regulations;
guaranteeing the non-discrimination of all
participants; boosting economic activity through
guaranteed policy bindings; and advancing trade
and development through progressive
liberalisation. The GATS functions on three
levels, similar to the accords on goods: the
primary text, which contains basic principles and
obligations; annexes, which deal with rules for
particular sectors; and individual nations' explicit
commitments to allow access to their markets. In
contrast to goods, the GATS provides a fourth
special element list that identifies the instances
where the most-favored-nation principle of non-
discrimination is not currently being followed by
a country.
Although services today make up more than two
thirds of global production and employment,
when measured on a basis of balance of
payments, they only account for no more than
25% of total commerce. However, this share-
while appearing modest-should not be
undervalued. Indeed, one of the GATS-defined
modes of service supply-the supply through
commercial presence in another country-is not
included in balance-of-payments figures (mode
3). Additionally, even while trade in services is
growing, they are also essential components in
the manufacturing of products. As a result, when
measured in terms of value added, services
make up around 50% of global commerce.
The two key pillars that support the GATS'
contribution to global services trade are (a)
increasing the openness and predictability of
pertinent rules and regulations and (b) fostering
progressive liberalisation through subsequent
rounds of talks. The latter idea is equivalent,
within the meaning of the Agreement, to
enhancing market access and extending national
treatment to foreign services and service
providers across a broader variety of sectors.
But it doesn't involve deregulation. Instead, the
Agreement emphasises clearly both the need for
developing nations in particular to exercise this
right, as well as governments' right to regulate
and enact new regulations to fulfil national policy
objectives.
The Agreement's overall framework and specific
sections were influenced by the concerns of
developing countries. In particular, the Preamble
to the Agreement and the provisions of Article IV
are motivated by the goal of supporting the
growing participation of developing nations in
services trade. This Article requires members to
negotiate specific commitments regarding the
improvement of developing countries' access to
distribution channels and information networks,
the strengthening of developing countries'
domestic service capacity, and the liberalisation
of market access in sectors of export interest to
these countries, among other things.
Although one of the fundamental principles of
the GATS is the idea of progressive
liberalisation, Article XIX stipulates that
liberalisation must take place with due
consideration for national policy objectives and
members' levels of development, both generally
and in specific sectors. Thus, developing nations
are given the option to gradually expand market
access while opening fewer sectors and fewer
types of transactions in accordance with their
stage of development. Other sections make sure
that developing nations have more freedom to
pursue economic integration policies, uphold
balance of payments limits, and control who can
access and utilise their telecommunications
transport networks and services. Additionally, the
WTO Secretariat is permitted to provide
technical assistance to developing nations.
World Intellectual Property Organization (WIPO)
The United Nations organisation devoted to
using intellectual property as a tool to foster
innovation and creativity is known as the World
Intellectual Property Organization (WIPO).
Following the WIPO Convention's entrance into
effect in 1967, WIPO was founded in 1970 with a
mission from its Member States to advance the
protection of intellectual property all over the
globe through intergovernmental cooperation
and cooperation with other international
organisations. Its goal is to foster innovation and
creativity through the creation of a fair and
efficient international intellectual property system
for the benefit of all nations' economic, social,
and cultural development.
In 1974, the Organization was designated as a
specialised agency of the UN. The WIPO's main
office is in Geneva. It is committed to creating a
fair and open worldwide intellectual property (IP)
system that encourages innovation, rewards
creativity, and advances economic growth while
protecting the general welfare. By signing a
cooperative agreement with the World Trade
Organization in 1996, WIPO enlarged its
mandate and further illustrated the significance
of intellectual property rights in the administration
of globalised trade.
In order to establish and unify laws and
procedures for the protection of intellectual
property rights, WIPO serves as a platform for its
Member States. Additionally, WIPO provides
global patent filing services as well as global
registration services for trademarks, industrial
designs, and appellations of origin. Systems for
protecting intellectual property have existed in
the majority of developed countries for decades.
However, many emerging and developing
nations are still constructing their legal
frameworks and systems for copyright, patents,
and trademarks. Through treaty negotiation,
registration, enforcement, legal and technical
assistance, and training in various forms, WIPO
plays a critical role in assisting these new
systems in evolving in light of the increasing
globalisation of trade and the rapid changes in
technological innovation.
The World Intellectual Property Organization
works to advance the growth and application of
the global intellectual property system by:
* Services - run systems which make it easier to
obtain protection internationally for patents,
trademarks, designs and appellations of origin;
and to resolve IP disputes.
* Law - develop the international legal IP
framework in line with society's evolving needs.
* Infrastructure - build collaborative networks and
technical platforms to share knowledge and
simplify IP transactions, including free databases
and tools for exchanging information.
* Development - build capacity in the use of IP to
support economic development. Legal
Frameworks under WIPO
* Patent Cooperation Treaty (PCT): The Paris
Convention's Patent Cooperation Treaty (PCT)
enables public access to a plethora of technical
data pertaining to such inventions while also
assisting applicants in securing patent protection
for their ideas on a global scale. Applicants are
able to concurrently apply for protection of an
innovation in a large number of nations by
submitting a single worldwide patent application
under the PCT.
* Madrid Agreement: The Madrid Agreement,
signed in 1891, and the Protocol pertaining to
that Agreement, signed in 1989, set forth the
rules for the Madrid System for the International
Registration of Marks. By acquiring an
international registration that is valid in each of
the specified Contracting Parties, the method
enables the protection of a mark across a wide
range of nations.
* Vienna Agreement: For marks that are
composed of or incorporate figurative features,
the Vienna Agreement creates an International
Classification of the Figurative Elements of
Marks known as the Vienna Classification.

as the WIPO Copyright Treaty (WCT) deals with
the protection of works and the rights of their

copyright protection: (i) computer programmes,
regardless of how they are expressed; and (ii)
collections of data or other materials
("databases").
* WIPO Performances and Phonograms Treaty
(WPPT): In especially in the digital context, the
WIPO Performances and Phonograms Treaty
(WPPT) deals with the rights of two categories of
beneficiaries: (i) performers (actors, singers,
musicians, etc.); and (ii) manufacturers of
phonograms (persons or legal entities that take
the initiative and have the responsibility for the
fixation of sounds).

Trade-Related Aspects of Intellectual Property
Rights (TRIPS)

Beyond simply transporting items across
borders, trade has developed to include the
value it brings to societies. Today's international
trade involves a significant amount of value
exchanged through innovation, creativity, and
branding. Development and trade policy
increasingly heavily weighs how to increase this
value and make it easier for knowledge-rich
commodities and services to move across
borders.
The TRIPS Agreement is essential for facilitating
intellectual property trade, settling intellectual
property trade disputes, and giving WTO
members the freedom to pursue their own
national goals. The Agreement formally
acknowledges the importance of the connections
between intellectual property and trade. That
was accomplished by the Uruguay Round. The
TRIPS Agreement is an attempt to put these
rights under common international law and to
close the gaps in how they are safeguarded and
upheld globally. It provides minimal requirements
for enforcement and protection of intellectual
property owned by citizens of other WTO
members by each government.
WTO countries have a great deal of flexibility
under the TRIPS Agreement to customise their
methods to IP protection and enforcement to
meet their needs and realise public policy
objectives. The Agreement gives members
plenty of leeway to strike a balance between the
long-term advantages of encouraging innovation
and the potential short-term costs of restricting
access to works of creative genius. Through a
variety of procedures permitted by TRIPS
provisions, such as exclusions or exceptions to
intellectual property rights, Members can lower
short-term costs. Additionally, the WTO's dispute
resolution mechanism is accessible in cases of
trade disputes involving the application of the
TRIPS Agreement.
The TRIPS Agreement addresses five main
topics:
* How general rules and fundamental ideas of
the global trading system apply to international
intellectual property?
                                                        What mechanisms
                                                        should members
                                                        offer to defend
* What are the minimum protection criteria for          those rights in
intellectual property rights that members should        their home
offer?                                              ?   countries?
* Specific interim framework for resolving
intellectual property disputes between WTO
members in order to implement TRIPS
requirements.
* Special transitional arrangements for the
implementation of TRIPS provisions.
THE CONCEPT OF INTELLECTUAL
PROPERTY
The term "intellectual property" refers to works
produced by the human mind and intellect. In
other words, intellectual property refers to
information that may be used to create tangible
goods simultaneously in an infinite number of
copies at various locations throughout the globe.
The information reflected in those copies, not the
copies themselves, is what grants the property
right. Similar to property rights in movable and
immovable property, intellectual property is also
characterised by certain rights as well as
limitations such as right to use and licence and
also limited duration in the case of copy right and
patents.
Industrial Property
The expression 'Industrial Property' is
sometimes misunderstood as relating to movable
or immovable property used for industrial
production. However, industrial property is a kind
of intellectual property and relates to creation of
human mind, e.g., inventions and industrial
designs. Simply stated, inventions are new
solutions to technological problems, and
industrial designs are aesthetic creations
determining the appearance of industrial
products. In addition, industrial property includes
trademarks, service marks, commercial names
and designations, including indications of source
and appellations of origin, and the protection
against unfair competition.
The term 'Industrial Property' may not appear
entirely logical in the sense that the inventions
are only concerned with the industry. In other
words, the inventions are exploited in industrial
plants while the trademarks, service marks, trade
names and service names are concerned with
both the commerce as well as industry.
Notwithstanding the lack of logic, this term has
acquired a meaning which clearly covers
inventions as well as other marks. The Paris
Convention also recognised industrial property to
cover patent, trademark, service mark, trade
names, utility models, industrial designs,
indication of source and appellations of origin
and the repression of unfair competition.
Hence, industrial property right is a collective
name for rights referring to the commercial or
industrial activities of a person. These activities
may include the activities of industrial or
commercial interests. They may be called
inventions, creations, new products, processes
of manufacture, new designs or model and a
distinctive mark for goods etc.
A person's commercial or industrial activities are
covered by a group of rights known as industrial
property rights. The actions of commercial or
industrial interests may be among these
activities. They can be referred to as inventions,
creations, new products, manufacturing
methods, new designs or models, and
distinguishing marks for commodities, among
other terms.
Patent
A patent is a monopoly award that gives the
inventor control over the output and, up to a
certain point in the demand curve, the price of
the patented goods. The patent system's primary
economic and commercial justification is that it
encourages investment in industrial innovation.
The upkeep and expansion of a country's stock
of valuable, transferable, and industrial assets
are both facilitated by innovative technologies.
An innovation, such as a product or a technique
that gives a novel approach to a problem or a
new technical solution, is given an exclusive right
known as a patent. An invention is the concept
for creating a novel and practical product,
process, or substance. Without the permission of
the patent holder, the innovation cannot be
made, utilised, disseminated, or sold for a profit.
For the duration that the invention is shielded by
a patent, the patent holder has the authority to
decide who may or may not use the invention.
The owner of the patent may provide another
party a licence to exploit the innovation under
mutually agreeable terms. Additionally, he has
the option to transfer ownership of the patent to
the buyer of the right to use the innovation. From
the day the patent application was submitted, the
patent is valid for 20 years. After a patent
expires, the invention is no longer protected and
becomes part of the public domain, meaning that
the owner no longer has the sole right to use the
invention.
Trade Mark
A trade mark tries to safeguard both the interests
of the trader and the customer by differentiating
the items of one manufacturer or trader from
comparable goods of others. A trademark can be
any combination of words, characters, numbers,
symbols, or devices showing images of people,
animals, or both. A trademark acts as an
effective form of advertising for the goods and
their quality since it denotes the relationship
between the merchant and the items during the
course of commerce. The goal of trademark law
is to give businesses the ability to acquire an
exclusive right to use, share, or assign a mark by
registering their mark. Similar to this, service
marks set one company's services apart from
those of other companies.
Like inventions and industrial designs, it is
patentable. Various combinations of words,
letters, numbers, symbols, drawings, images,
and even sounds can be used as a trademark.
These are typically registered for seven years,
but by reapplying, they can be renewed
indefinitely. It guarantees the owner of the mark
the sole right to use it to distinguish products or
services, or to grant another person permission
to use it in exchange for payment. Because of
the nature and quality of the goods or service,
which are denoted by its distinctive trademark, it
aids consumers in recognising and purchasing it.
Copyright
The idea of Copyright protection only began to
emerge with the invention of printing, which
made it for literary works to be duplicated by
mechanical processes instead of being copied
by hand. This led to the grant of privileges, by
authorities and kings, entitling beneficiaries
exclusive rights of reproduction and distribution,
for limited period, with remedies in the form of
fines, seizure, confiscation of infringing copies
and possibly damages.
However, the criticism of the system of privileges
led to the adoption of the Statute of Anne in
1709, the first copyright Statute. In the 18th
century there was dispute over the relationship
between copyright subsisting in common law
and copyright under the Statute of Anne. This
was finally settled by House of Lords in 1774
which ruled that at common law the author had
the sole right of printing and publishing his book,
but that once a book was published the rights in
it were exclusively regulated by the Statute. This
common law right in unpublished works lasted
until the Copyright Act, 1911, which abolished
the Statute of Anne.
Copyright is a well recognised form of property
right which had its roots in the common law
system and subsequently came to be governed
by the national laws in each country. Copyright
as the name suggests arose as an exclusive
right of the author to copy the literature produced
by him and stop others from doing so.
There are well-known instances of legal
intervension to punish a person for copying
literary or aesthetic out put of another even
before the concept of copyright took shape. The
concept of idea was originally concerned with the
field of literature and arts. In view of
technological advancements in recent times,
copyright protection has been expanded
considerably. Today, copyright law has extended
protection not only to literary, dramatic, musical
and artistic works but also sound recordings,
films, broadcasts, cable programmes and
typographical arrangements of publications.
Computer programs have also been brought
within the purview of copyright law.
Thus, the copyright deals with the rights of
intellectual creators in their creation. The
copyright law deals with the particular forms of
creativity, concerned primarily with mass
communication. It is also concerned with virtually
all forms and methods of public communication,
not only printed publications but also with such
matters as sound, and television broadcasting,
films for public exhibition etc. and even
computerised systems for the storage and
retrieval of information. The copyright law,
however, protects only the form of expression of
ideas themselves. The creativity protected by
copyright law is creativity in the choice and
arrangement of words, musical notes, colours,
shapes and so on. In India, the law relating to
copyright is governed by the Copyright Act, 1957
which has been amended in 1983, 1984, 1985,
1991, 1992, 1994, 1999 and 2012. The
amendment introduced in 1984 included
computer program within the definition of literary
work and a new definition of computer program
was inserted by the 1994 amendment. The
philosophical justification for including computer
programs under literary work has been that
computer programs are also products of
intellectual skill like any other literary work.
In 1999, the Copyright Act, 1957 has been
amended to give effect to the provisions of
Article 14 of the TRIPs agreement providing
term of protection to performers rights at least
until the end of a period of fifty years computed
from the end of the calendar year in which the
performance took place. The Amendment Act
also inserted new Section 40A empowering the
Central Government to extend the provisions of
the Copyright Act to broadcasts and
performances made in other countries subject to
the condition however that such countries extend
similar protection to broadcasts and
performances made in India. Another new
Section 42A empowers the Central Government
to restrict rights of foreign broadcasting
organisations and performers.
Industrial Designs
Industrial designs belong to the aesthetic field,
but are at the same time intended to serve as
pattern for the manufacture of products of
industry or handicraft. An industrial design is the
ornamental or aesthetic aspect of a useful article,
which must appeal to the sense of sight and may
consist of the shape and/or pattern and/or colour
of article. An industrial design to be protectable,
must be new and origin. Industrial designs are
protected against unauthorised copying or
limitation, for a period which usually lasts for five,
ten or fifteen years.
Textile designs were the first to receive legal
protection. As early as 1787 the first Act for
design protection was enacted in Great Britain
for the Encouragement of the Arts of design and
printing Linens, cotton, calicoes and Muslims, by
vesting properties thereof in the Designers,
Printers and Proprietors for a limited time. This
was an experimental measure extending
protection for a limited duration. Shortly
thereafter its life was extended and soon
afterwards it was made perpetual. In 1839 the
protection under the Act was enlarged to cover
"Designs for Printing other woven Fabrics".
In the same year another Act was passed for
design protection for articles of manufacture
generally. An Act to secure to Proprietors of
Designs for Articles of Manufacture the
Copyright of such Designs for a limited time. The
legislative process for design protection took
rapid strides thereafter. A consolidating and
updating measure enacted in 1842. An Act to
consolidate and amend the laws relating to the
Copyright of Designs for ornamenting Articles of
manufacture-repealed all the earlier statutes
referred to above.
It is significant to observe that when the designs
law was codified in 1842 and took its modern day
shape, copyright protection had not yet been
extended to drawings, paintings and
photographs. This came only twenty years later
with the enactment of the Fine Arts Copyright
Act, 1862. Codification of copyright law was
nowhere in sight and came only seventy years
later with the enactment of the Imperial
Copyright Act, 1911. Until 1883 the statutes
relating to patents, designs and trademarks
remained separate. They were combined in a
single enactment by the Patents, Designs, and
Trade Marks Act, 1883, which repealed all the
then existing statutes in the three areas. Soon
trademarks law parted company and was
separately enacted as the Trade Marks Act,
1905, leaving patents and designs to remain
together. The Patents and Designs Act, 1907,
consolidated the enactments relating to patents
and designs.
The first designs legislation enacted in India was
the Patterns and Designs Protection Act, 1872. It
was enacted as a supplement to the Statute-Act
15 of 1859-passed by the Governor-General of
India in Council which for the first time made
provision for granting to inventors of "new
manufacture the exclusive privilege of making,
selling and using the invention in India or
authorising others to do so for a specified term.
The Act of 1872 was passed to extend similar
privileges to the inventors of new patterns and
designs in British India, though for a very shorter
duration of years. It included in the term new
manufacture any new and original pattern or
design, or the application of such pattern or
design to any substance or article of
manufacture". The Act, however, left undefined
the expression new pattern or design.
The Inventions and Designs Act, 1898, which
consolidated and amended the law relating to
the protection of inventions and designs
contained provisions relating to designs in a
separate part. The (British) Patents and Designs
Act, 1907, became the basis of the Indian
Patents and Designs Act, 1911. The patents
provisions of the Indian Patents and Designs
Act, 1911, were repealed by the Patents Act,
1970, a post-Independence updating and
consolidation of the patents law. The design
provisions of the Indian Patents and Designs
Act, 1911, continue, with some consequential
amendments, with the title as the Designs Act,
1911. The new Designs Act, 2000 has been
passed by the Parliament.
geographical Indication (gI)
Geographical Indicator is that part of industrial
property that designates a nation or a location
within it as the nation or place of origin of that
product. Such a name typically carries a
guarantee of quality and individuality, which is
mostly due to the fact that it originated in the
specified geographical place, region, or nation.
Signs that identify a product's exact geographic
origin are known as geographic indicators. A GI
identifies a product's origin, which could be a
village or town, a region, or a nation, and
identifies the product's unique traits. Since it is
an exclusive privilege granted to a certain
community, all of the community's members
profit from its registration. All producers or
traders whose goods originate from that location
and have defining traits may use it.
Geographical Indications are covered by Articles
22 to 24 of the WTO Agreement on Trade-
Related Aspects of Intellectual Property Rights
(TRIPS), which was a component of the
Agreements that concluded the Uruguay Round
of GATT negotiations. The Geographical
Indications of Goods (Registration and
Protection) Act, 1999 was passed by India as a
WTO member. It was enacted in December
1999, and it became effective on September 15,
2003. With this Act, geographical indicators for
commodities in India are to be registered and
given additional protection.

Bordeaux wine, Darjeeling tea, Chanderi sarees,
Kullu shawls, Tuscany olive oil, Kanchipuram silk
sarees, Alphanso Mango, Nagpur orange, and
Kolhapuri (Chappal) are well-known examples of
GIs.
Trade Secret
A trade secret is a method, practise, procedure,
design, instrument, pattern, or collection of
information that is not widely known or easily
discoverable and through which a company
might gain a competitive edge over rivals or
clients. An enterprise may gain a competitive
edge from secret business information. Sales
techniques, distribution strategies, consumer
profiles, marketing plans, client and supplier lists,
production procedures, and advertising
strategies are all examples of trade secrets. A
trade secret can be preserved indefinitely, but
there must be a significant amount of secrecy,
making it difficult to obtain the information unless
inappropriate means are used.
NATIONAL INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY
RIgHTS POLICY
The Indian government has provided the
exclusive right of intellectual property to
safeguard the originality of inventors' works. The
simplest form of intellectual property is an
intangible work of human imagination. This
intellectual property contains rights centred on
copyright, patents, trademarks, trade names,
industrial designs, and merchandise. Maintaining
intellectual property rights is crucial for the
quality, safety, and effectiveness of all
pharmaceutical products and services. For the
certification and identification of products in a
large market, it serves as a standard authority
and certification body. The privileges granted to
individuals over the works of their imaginations
are known as intellectual property rights.
Typically, they grant the creator a limited time,
exclusive permission to utilise his or her works.
The term "intellectual property" refers to human
inventions in the fields of art, literature, science,
and industry. This application is crucial for
protecting the inventor's invention and upholding
the inventor's work's high standards of quality.
As a result of these changes, the government
decided to create a roadmap for IPRs in the
nation. The National Intellectual Property Rights
Policy was put into place to encourage
innovation, enhance the business climate, and
make it easier to commercially utilise intellectual
property. The Policy is in accordance with India's
proclamation that this decade is the "Decade of
Innovation".
On May 12th, 2016, the Union Cabinet approved
the IPR Policy. It acknowledges India's well-
established, TRIPScompliant legal structure to
protect IPRs and strives to balance her
development objectives by making use of the
flexibilities offered by the global regime. The
Policy places a special emphasis on spreading
knowledge about IPRs and emphasising their
value as a marketable financial asset and a tool
for the economy.
IPR Policy focus on:
* Improving access to healthcare, food security,
and environmental protection, among other
areas of critical social, economic, and
technological importance.
* fostering creativity and innovation and thereby
promote entrepreneurship and enhance socio-
economic and cultural development.
The Policy outlines seven goals that are further
defined with actions that must be taken by the
designated nodal Ministry or Department. The
goals are briefly discussed below:-
* IPR Awareness: Outreach and Promotion - To
create public awareness about the economic,
social and cultural benefits of IPRs among all
sections of society.
* generation of IPRs - To stimulate the
generation of IPR.
* Legal and Legislative Framework - To have
strong and effective IPR laws, which balance the
interests of rights owners with larger public
interest.
                                                                  Commercialization
* Administration and Management - To                              of IPR - Get value
modernize and strengthen service oriented IPR                     for IPRs through
administration.                                 ?                 commercialization.
* Enforcement and Adjudication - To strengthen
the enforcement and adjudicatory mechanisms
for combating IPR infringements.
* Human Capital Development - To strengthen
and expand human resources, institutions and
capacities for teaching, training, research and
skill building in IPRs.

REgULATORY FRAMEWORK
> Patents Act 1970
> Patents Rules 2003
The term 'Patent' acquired a statutory meaning
in India under the Patents Act, 1970. The Act
and the Rules framed under it, i.e. the Patent
Rules, 2003 regulate the subjects like the grant,
the operative period, the revocation, and
infringement etc. of the Patents.
INTRODUCTION
A Patent is a statutory right for an invention
granted for a limited period of time to the
patentee by the Government, in exchange of full
disclosure of his invention for excluding others,
from making, using, selling, importing the
patented product or process for producing that
product for those purposes without his consent.
Patent is a monopoly grant and it enables the
inventor to control the output and within the limits
set by demand, the price of the patented
products. Underlying economic and commercial
justification for the patent system is that it acts
as a stimulus to investment in the Industrial
innovation. Innovative technology leads to the
maintenance of and increase in nations stock of
valuable, tradable and industrial assets.
The law relating to patents contained in the
Patents Act, 1970 .The Patents Act was enacted
by the Government of India in the year 1970 in
pursuance of its powers under Entry 49 of the
List I of Schedule VII of the Constitution of India.
List I contains the list of the items in the Union
List and Entry 49 reads, "Patents, inventions and
designs; copyright; trade-marks and
merchandise marks." The Act was notified on
19th September 1970. It has been amended in
the year 1995, 1999, 2002 and 2005. With
increase in the technological progress of India,
the fundamental reasoning of the Act is that
patents are given to promote innovations &
developments and to ensure that these creations
got recognition commercially without delay; and
patents are conceded to empower patentee to
commercially utilize the monopoly for the
importation of the patented product into the
nation. The similar rationality is applicable in
compulsory licensing, certification cum
registration of process patents for sustenance, or
medication, other products like pesticides came
through synthetic procedures which, aside from
compound substances ordinarily incorporate
things, for example, combinations, optical glass,
semi-transmitters, alloys, etc. It might,
nonetheless, be noticed that items fundamental
for our economy, for example, agribusiness and
cultivation items, nuclear vitality creations and all
organic products are not patentable. So, the
Patents legislation was relied upon to provide a
sensible adjust amongst satisfactory & efficient
security of patents from one perspective and the
innovation improvement, open intrigue and
particular needs of the nation on another.
PATENTS
Section 2(1) (m) of the Patents Act, 1970,
defines the term patent as to mean a patent for
any invention granted under Patents Act.
An invention is considered as new (novel), if it is
not anticipated by prior publication in patent and
non-patent literature, i.e., an invention is novel if
it has not been disclosed in the prior art, where
the prior art means everything that has been
published, presented or otherwise disclosed to
the public before the date of filing/ priority date of
complete specification. An invention is
considered as novel, if it has not been
anticipated by prior use or prior public knowledge
in India.
In the case of Bishwanath Prasad Radhey
Shyam v. Hindustan Metal Industries, (1979) 2
SCC 511, it was held by the Hon'ble Supreme
Court of India that the object of Patent law is to
encourage scientific research, new technology
and industrial progress. A limited-time grant of
the only right to own, use, or sell a patented
method or product encourages the development
of new commercially useful inventions. The
disclosure of the invention to the Patent Office,
which becomes public domain after a
predetermined duration of the monopoly, is the
cost of the monopoly grant.
Advantages of Patents
> Patentee have the complete rights to restrict
outsider from making, operating, providing
accessibility to be bought, providing or putting in
the product generated by him, without his
consent. He has absolute prerogative to utilize
his invention and his rights that are very much
ensured under the Act.
> The patentee has a privilege to file the suit for
encroachment of his patent and can ask for
remedies like, Injunction, compensation and a
settlement of profit against the individual who
encroached his patent.

> Patentee can commercially exploit or pitch his
creation to any skilled individual and concede
permit to him to abuse his item and in this way
the patentee can likewise wins benefit along
these lines.
> The holder of the exclusive permit can also
avail the rights given to the patentee and can
bring a suit if there should arise an occurrence of
any encroachment of Patent.
> A patentee gets the privilege to make changes
in or alterations of an invention depicted or
uncovered in the total determination of the
primary innovation and get the particular right of
a patent by the substantial change or patent as a
matter of addition/certain adjustment.
It may be noted that according to Section 2(1) (p)
of the Patents Act, 1970, the term patentee as to
mean the person for the time being entered on
the register as the grantee or proprietor of the
patent.
What can be Patented?
An invention relating either to a product or
process that is new, involving inventive step and
capable of industrial application can be patented.
However, it must not fall into the categories of
inventions that are non- patentable under
sections 3 and 4 of the Act.
It may be noted that Section 2(1) (j) of the Act,
defines invention as to mean a new product or
process involving an inventive step and capable
of Industrial application.
Capable of industrial application, in relation to an
invention, means that the invention is capable of
being made or used in an industry as defined
under Section 2(1) (ac) of the Act.
Also, Section 2(1) (l) defines the term new
invention as to mean any invention or technology
which has not been anticipated by publication in
any document or used in the country or
elsewhere in the world before the date of filing of
patent application with complete specification,
i.e. the subject matter has not fallen into public
domain or that it does not form part of the state
of the art.
As per legal regime of Intellectual Property
Right, invention is something construed as new
substance or altogether new process having
inventive stage/action and potential of industrial
usage & relevance. Inventive stage/step include
certain aspects of action which are not palpable
& evident to the person experienced in the art.
The real purpose of patent system is stimulating
new innovative practices & technological
development to market for public interest.
In Raj Prakash v. Mangat Ram Choudhary AIR
1978 Delhi 1, it was held that inventive creation,
as is notable, is to discover something or find
something not found or found by anybody
previously. It isn't essential that the invention
ought to be anything confounded. The
fundamental thing is that the creator was first to
embrace it. The main issue in this manner, is
that each basic creation is asserted, as in the
form of novelty or new character, it will be
considered as an invention and the cases &
specifications must be perused in that light.
What are not inventions
The following are not inventions within the
meaning of Section 3 of the Act:
a) an invention which is frivolous or which claims
anything obviously contrary to well established
natural laws;
b) an invention the primary or intended use or
commercial exploitation of which could be
contrary to public order or morality or which
causes serious prejudice to human, animal or
plant life or health or to the environment;
c) the mere discovery of a scientific principle or
the formulation of an abstract theory or discovery
of any living thing or non-living substances
occurring in nature;
d) the mere discovery of a new form of a known
substance which does not result in the
enhancement of the known efficacy of that
substance or the mere discovery of any property
or mere new use for a known substance or of the
mere use of a known process, machine or
apparatus unless such known process results in
a new product or employs at least one new
reactant;
Explanation to clause (d) clarifies that salts,
esters, polymorphs, metabolites, pure form,
particle size, isomers, mixtures of isomers,
complexes, combinations and other derivatives
of known substance shall be considered to be
the same substance, unless they differ
significantly in properties with regard to efficacy.
e) a substance obtained by a mere admixture
resulting only in the aggregation of the
properties of the components thereof or a
process for producing such substance;
f) the mere arrangement or re-arrangement or
duplication of known devices each functioning
independently of one another in a known way;
g) a method of agriculture or horticulture;
h) any process for the medicinal, surgical,
curative, prophylactic diagnostic, therapeutic or
other treatment of human beings or any process
for a similar treatment of animals to render them
free of disease or to increase their economic
value or that of their products;
i) plants and animals in whole or any part thereof
other than micro-organisms but including seeds,
varieties and species and essentially biological
processes for production or propagation of plants
and animals;
j) a mathematical or business method or a
computer programme per se or algorithms;
k) a literary, dramatic, musical or artistic work or
any other aesthetic creation whatsoever
including cinematographic works and television
productions;
l) a mere scheme or rule or method of performing          a presentation of
mental act or method of playing game;                m)   information;
n) topography of integrated circuits;
o) an invention which in effect, is traditional
knowledge or which is an aggregation or
duplication of known properties of traditionally
known component or components;
Section 4 prohibits the grant of patent in respect
of an invention relating to atomic energy falling
within Sub- section (1) of Section 20 of the
Atomic Energy Act, 1962.
After analysing the legislative history of Section
3(d), the Hon'ble Supreme Court in the matter of
Novartis AG Vs. Union of India, W.P.No.
24760/06, commented, "We have, therefore, no
doubt that the amendment/addition made in
section 3(d) is meant especially to deal with
chemical substances, and more particularly
pharmaceutical products. The amended portion
of section 3(d) clearly sets up a second tier of
qualifying standards for chemical substances/
pharmaceutical products in order to leave the
door open for true and genuine inventions but, at
the same time, to check any attempt at repetitive
patenting or extension of the patent term on
spurious grounds.
It was further held by the Apex Court :
In the case of medicines, efficacy means
therapeutic efficacy and physico-chemical
properties of substances do not meet the
requirement of therapeutic efficacy .
It was also held that patent applicants must
prove the increase in therapeutic efficacy and
just increased bioavailability alone may not
necessarily lead to an enhancement of
therapeutic efficacy, and in any given case,
enhanced efficacy must be specifically claimed
and established by research data.
In this regard, in Para 187 of the Apex Court
judgment, it is held that, "..........the physico-
chemical properties of beta crystalline form of
Imatinib Mesylate, namely (i) more beneficial flow
properties, (ii) better thermodynamic stability,
and (iii) lower hygroscopicity, may be otherwise
beneficial but these properties cannot even be
taken into account for the purpose of the test of
section 3(d) of the Act, since these properties
have nothing to do with therapeutic efficacy."
What are the Criteria of Patentability? An
invention is patentable subject matter if it meets
the following criteria -                              >   It should be novel.
> It should have inventive step or it must be non-
obvious.
> It should be capable of Industrial application.
> It should not attract the provisions of section 3
and 4 of the Patents Act, 1970.
It may be noted that Section 2(1) (ja) of the Act
defines the term inventive step as to mean a
feature of an invention that involves technical
advance as compared to the existing knowledge
or having economic significance or both that
makes the invention not obvious to a person
skilled in the art.
Persons Entitled to make Application for Patent
Section 6 of the Act provides that an application
for a patent for an invention may be made by any
of the following persons, that is to say:
a) by any person claiming to be the true and first
inventor of the invention;
b) by any person being the assignee of the
person claiming to be the true and first inventor
in respect of the right to make such an
application;
c) by the legal representative of any deceased
person who immediately before his death was
entitled to make such an application.
The application may be made by one of the
persons either alone or jointly with any other
person.
It may be noted that Section 2(1) (a) of the Act
defines the term assignee as to include the legal
representative of a deceased assignee, and
references to the assignee of any person include
references to the assignee of the legal
representative or assignee of that person.
Form of Application and Provisional & Complete
Specification
The Specification is a techno-legal document
containing scientific and technical disclosure and
claims for the invention which is the basis of
rights of a patent. The Specification, thus, forms
a crucial part of the patent application.
Section 7 dealing with form of application
requires every application for a patent to be
made for one invention only. Where the
application is made by virtue of an assignment
of the right to apply for a patent for the invention,
there shall be furnished with the application
proof of the right to make the application.
Every international application under the Patent
Cooperation Treaty (PCT) for a patent, as may
be filed designating India shall be deemed to be
an application under the Act, if a corresponding
application has also been filed before Controller
in India. The filing date of such application and
its complete specification processed by patent
office as designated office or elected office shall
be the international filing date accorded under
the PCT.

What is the Patent Cooperation Treaty (PCT)?
The PCT is an international treaty with more
than 150 Contracting States which are bound
with certain formal requirements set out in the
Treaty and Regulations. The PCT makes it
possible to seek patent protection for an
invention simultaneously in a large number of
countries by filing a single international patent
application instead of filing several separate
national or regional patent applications however,
granting of patents remains under the control of
the national or regional patent offices after the
corresponding national phase application has
been filed and the national phase application is
assessed as per patent law of that jurisdiction.
Section 7(4) provides that every such
application, not being a convention application or
an application filed under PCT designating India,
shall be accompanied by a provisional or a
complete specification.
Section 9 stipulates that where an application for
a patent (not being a convention application or
an application filed under PCT designating India)
is accompanied by a provisional specification, a
complete specification shall be filed within twelve
months from the date of filing of the application,
and if the complete specification is not so filed,
the application shall be deemed to be
abandoned. Where two or more applications in
the name of the same applicant are
accompanied by provisional specifications in
respect of inventions which are cognate or of
which one is a modification of another and the
Controller is of opinion that the whole of such
inventions are such as to constitute a single
invention and may properly be included in one
patent, he may allow one complete specification
to be filed in respect of all such provisional
specifications. However, the period of twelve
months shall be reckoned from the date of filing
of the earliest provisional specification.
Where an application for a patent (not being a
convention application or an application filed
under PCT designating India) is accompanied by
a specification purporting to be a complete
specification, the Controller may, if the applicant
so requests at any time within twelve months
from the date of filing of the application, direct
that such specification shall be treated as a
provisional specification and proceed with the
application accordingly. Where a complete
specification has been filed in pursuance of an
application for a patent accompanied by a
provisional specification or by a specification
treated by virtue of a direction under subsection
(3) as a provisional specification, the Controller
may, if the applicant so requests at any time
before the grant of patent, cancel the provisional
specification and post-date the application to the
date of filing of the complete specification.
When should an Application for a Patent be
Filed?
An application for a patent can be filed at the
earliest possible date and should not be delayed.
An application filed with provisional specification,
disclosing the essence of the nature of the
invention helps to register the priority of the
invention. Delay in filing an application may
entail some risks such as:
(i) some other inventor might file a patent
application on the said invention and
(ii) there may be either an inadvertent publication
of the invention by the inventor himself/herself or
by others independently of him/her.

Section 10 dealing with contents of
Specifications provides that every specification,
whether provisional or complete, shall describe
the invention and begin with a title sufficiently
indicating the subject matter to which the
invention relates.
Every complete specification is required to -
a) fully and particularly describe the invention
and its operation or use and the method by
which it is to be performed;
b) disclose the best method of performing the
invention which is known to the applicant and for
which he is entitled to claim protection;
c) end with a claim or claims defining the scope
of the invention for which protection is claimed;
and
d) be accompanied by an abstract to provide
technical information on the invention.
However, the Controller may amend the abstract
for providing better information to third parties
and if the applicant mentions a biological
material in the specification which may not be
described in such a way as to satisfy clauses (a)
and (b) above and if such material is not
available to the public, the application shall be
completed by depositing the material to an
International Depository Authority under the
Budapest Treaty and by fulfilling the following
conditions, namely:
(i) the deposit of the material shall be made not
later than the date of filing the patent application
in India and a reference thereof shall be made in
the specification within the prescribed period;
(ii) all the available characteristics of the material
required for it to be correctly identified or
indicated are included in the specification
including the name, address of the depository
institution and the date and number of the
deposit of the material at the institution;
(iii) access to the material is available in the
depository institution only after the date of the
application for patent in India or if a priority is
claimed after the date of the priority;
(iv) disclose the source and geographical origin
of the biological material in the specification,
when used in an invention.
In case of an international application
designating India the title, description, drawings,
abstracts and claims filed with the application
shall be taken as the complete specification for
the purposes of the Act.
The claim or claims of a complete specification
shall relate to a single invention, or to a group of
inventions linked so as to form a single inventive
concept, shall be clear and succinct and shall be
fairly based on the matter disclosed in the
specification.
Any kind of innovation/invention is patented for
making monetary profit and that it can be
identified further when it got the status of
exclusivity in a commercial market. A feature of
exclusivity or monopoly is attained when
description in patent specification is clear on the
part of being novel. Patentee can rightfully
exploit his monopoly either by utilizing
marketable strategies over patented product or
by licensing the same to a different person. A
patentee also has privilege to assign the
invention to third person by way of deed. Special
thing about patented invention is that its
monetary value can increase with passage of
time. Right of licensing is also one of the
acceptable way to commercially exploit patented
invention and prevent it from any possible kind of
unauthorized usage and patent holder can retain
exclusive commercial right.
How a Patent Specification is prepared?
A patent specification can be prepared by the
applicant himself or his registered and
authorized agent. The patent specification
generally comprises of the title of the invention
indicating its technical field, prior art, draw backs
in the prior art, the solution provided by the
inventor to obviate the drawbacks of the prior art,
a concise but sufficient description of the
invention and its usefulness, drawings (if any)
and details of best method of its working. The
complete specification must contain atleast one
claim or statement of claims defining the scope
of the invention for which protection is sought for.
Publication of Applications
Section 11A(1) provides that save as provided
otherwise, no application for patents shall
ordinarily be open to public for such period as
may be prescribed. Sub-section (2) entitles an
applicant to request the Controller, in the
prescribed manner, to publish his application at
any time before the expiry of the period
prescribed under sub-section (1) and subject to
the provisions of sub-section (3). The Controller
on receipt of such request shall publish such
application as soon as possible. Every
application for patent shall be published on
expiry of the period specified in sub-section (1)
except those applications in which secrecy
direction is imposed under section 35; or
application has been abandoned under section
9(1); or application has been withdrawn three
months prior to the period specified under sub-
section (1).
The publication of every application shall include
the particulars of the date of application, number
of application, name and address of the
applicant identifying the application and an
abstract. Upon publication of an application for a
patent, the depository institution shall make the
biological material mentioned in the specification
available to the public. The patent office may, on
payment of prescribed fee make the
specification and drawings, if any, of such
application available to the public.
Section 11A(7) provides that on or from the date
of publication of the application for patent and
until the date of grant of a patent in respect of
such application, the applicant shall have the like
privileges and rights as if a patent for invention
had been granted on the date of publication of
application. However, the applicant shall have no
right to institute any proceedings for infringement
until the patent has been granted. Additionally,
the rights of a patentee in respect of applications
made under Section 5(2) before January 1,2005
shall accrue from the date of grant of patent.
Moreover, after the patent is granted in respect
of applications made under Section 5(2), the
patent holder shall only be entitled to receive
reasonable royalty from such enterprises which
have made significant investment and were
producing and marketing concerned product
prior to January 1, 2005 and which continue to
manufacture the product covered by the patent
on the date of grant of the patent and no
infringement proceedings shall be instituted
against such enterprises.
When is an Application for Patent Published?
Every application for patent is published after
expiry of 18 months from the date of its filing or
priority date whichever is earlier. However,
following applications are not published.
(A) Application in which secrecy direction is
imposed.
(B) Application which has been abandoned u/s
9(1) and i.e. when a provisional application has
been filed and the complete application has not
been filed with 12 months from the filing of the
provisional application.
(C) Application which has been withdrawn 3
months prior to 18 months.

Request for Examination
Section 11B provides that no application for a
patent shall be examined unless the applicant or
any other interested person makes a request in
the prescribed manner for such examination
within the prescribed period. In case of an
application in respect of a claim for a patent filed
under Section 5(2) before January1, 2005, a
request for examination shall be made in the
prescribed manner for such examination within
the prescribed period, by the applicant or any
other interested person.
In case the applicant or any other interested
person does not make a request for examination
of the application for a patent within the specified
period, the application shall be treated as
withdrawn by the applicant. However the
applicant may, at any time after filing the
application but before the grant of the patent,
withdraw the application by making a request in
the prescribed manner; and in a case secrecy
direction has been issued under Section 35, the
request for examination may be made within the
prescribed period from the date of revocation of
the secrecy direction.
Examination of Application
Section 12 dealing with examination of
application provides that when the request for
examination has been filed in respect of an
application for a patent in the prescribed manner
under Section 11B (1) or (3), the application and
specification and other documents related
thereto shall be referred at the earliest by the
Controller to an examiner for making a report to
him in respect of the following matters, namely:
a) whether the application and the specification
and other documents relating thereto are in
accordance with the requirements of the Act and
of any rules made thereunder;
b) whether there is any lawful ground of objection
to the grant of the patent in pursuance of the
application;
c) the result of investigations made under
Section 13; and
d) any other matter which may be prescribed.
The examiner to whom the application and the
specification and other documents relating
thereto are referred shall ordinarily make the
report to the Controller within the prescribed
period.
Search for Anticipation by Previous Publication
and by Prior Claim
Section 13 dealing with search for anticipation by
previous publication and by prior claim provides
that the examiner to whom the application for a
patent is referred shall make investigation for the
purpose of ascertaining whether the invention so
far as claimed in any claim of the complete
specification:
(a) has been anticipated by publication before
the date of filing of the applicant's complete
specification in any specification filed in
pursuance of an application for a patent made in
India and dated on or after the 1st day of
January, 1912;
(b) is claimed in any claim of any other complete
specification published on or after the date of
filing of the applicant's complete specification,
being a specification filed in pursuance of an
application for a patent made in India and dated
before or claiming the priority date earlier than
that date.
The examiner shall, in addition, make such
investigation for the purpose of ascertaining
whether the invention so far as claimed in any
claim of the complete specification has been
anticipated by publication in India or elsewhere
in any document other than those mentioned in
Section 13(1) before the date of filing of the
applicant's complete specification. In case a
complete specification has been amended
before the grant of a patent, the amended
specification shall be examined and investigated
in the like manner as the original specification.
Consideration of the Report of Examiner by
Controller
Section 14 provides that in case the report of the
examiner is adverse to the applicant and
requires any amendment of the application,
specification or other documents, the Controller
shall, before proceeding to dispose of the
application, communicate the gist of obligations
to the applicant as expeditiously as possible and
afford him an opportunity of hearing.
Power of Controller to Refuse or Require
Amended Application in Certain matters
Section 15 empowers the Controller to refuse
the application or to require the application,
specification or other documents to be amended,
if he is satisfied that the application or any
specification or any other document filed in
pursuance thereof does not comply with the
provisions of the Act and the rules made
thereunder.
Power of Controller to make Orders Respecting
Dating of Application and Cases of Anticipation
Section 17 provides that at any time after the
filing of an application and before the grant of
the patent, the Controller may at the request of
the applicant direct that the application shall be
post-dated to such date as may be specified in
the request and proceed with the application
accordingly. However, no application shall be
post-dated to a date later than six months from
the date on which it was actually made or would
be deemed to have been made.
Where an application or specification (including
drawings) or any other document is required to
be amended under Section 15, the application or
specification or other document shall, if the
Controller so directs, be deemed to have been
made on the date on which the requirement is
complied with or where the application or
specification or other document is returned to the
applicant, the date on which it is refiled after
complying with the requirement.
Section 18 says that where it appears to the
Controller that the invention so far as claimed in
any claim of the complete specification has been
anticipated, he may refuse the application unless
the applicant:
a) shows to the satisfaction of the Controller that
the priority date of the claim of his complete
specification is not later than the date on which
the relevant document was published; or
b) amends his complete specification to the
satisfaction of the Controller.
If it appears to the Controller that the invention is
claimed in a claim of any other complete
specification, he may, direct that a reference to
that other specification be inserted in the
applicant's complete specification unless the
applicant shows to the satisfaction of the
Controller that the priority date of his claim is not
later than the priority date of the claim of the said
other specification; or the complete specification
has been amended to his satisfaction.
Similar provision also applies in the case where
it appears to the Controller that the invention so
far claimed in any claim of the applicant's
complete specification has been claimed in other
complete specification referred to in section
13(1)(a) and that such other complete
specification was published on or before the
priority date of the applicant's claim.
Potential Infringement
Patent infringement is the violation of the
exclusive rights of the patent holder. The
Patents Act 1970, does not specifically define
activities or situations that constitute patent
infringement. Section 48 of the Patents Act gives
the patent holder/ patentee an 'exclusive right' to
exclude any third- party from making, using,
offering, selling, manufacturing etc. the patented
invention/ product/ process, during the valid term
of the patent. This essentially creates
monopolistic rights over the patented invention/
product/ process. Thus, any activity which
violates such a monopoly can be considered a
patent infringement. In cases of patent
infringement, the patent holder has the right to
sue the infringing party to get relief and
compensation for the damage caused. Sections
104-114 of the Act provide certain guidelines
relating to patent infringement.
Section 19 provides that if in consequence of the
investigations it appears to the Controller that an
invention in respect of which an application for a
patent has been made cannot be performed
without substantial risk of infringement of a claim
of any other patent, he may direct that a
reference to that other patent, be inserted in the
applicant's complete specification by way of
notice to the public within such time as may be
prescribed, unless
a) the applicant shows to the satisfaction of the
Controller that there are reasonable grounds for
contesting the validity of the said claim of the
other patent; or
b) the complete specification is amended to the
satisfaction of the Controller.
The reference shall be inserted in the following
form, namely:
Reference has been directed, in pursuance of
Section 19(2) of the Patents Act, 1970 to Patent
No........
Where after a reference to another patent has
been inserted in a complete specification in
pursuance of a direction under Section 19(1):
a) that other patent is revoked or otherwise
ceases to be in force; or
b) the specification of that other patent is
amended by the deletion of the relevant claim; or
c) it is found, in proceedings before the court or
the Controller, that the relevant claim of that
other patent is invalid or is not infringed by any
working of the applicant's invention, the
Controller may, on the application of the
applicant delete the reference to that other
patent.
Substitution of Applicants
Section 20 says that if the Controller is satisfied,
on a claim made in prescribed manner at any
time before a patent has been granted that by
virtue of any assignment or agreement in writing
made by the applicant or one of the applicants
for the patent or by operation of law, the claimant
would, if the patent were then granted, be
entitled thereto or to the interest of the applicant
therein, or to an undivided share of the patent or
of that interest, the Controller may direct that the
application shall proceed in the name of the
claimant or in the names of the claimants and
the applicant or the other joint applicant or
applicants, accordingly as the case may be. No
such direction shall however, be given by virtue
of any assignment or agreement made by one of
the two or more joint applicants for a patent
except with the consent of the other joint
applicant or applicants. Further, no such
direction shall be given by virtue of any
assignment or agreement for the assignment of
the benefit of an invention unless:
a) the invention is identified therein by reference
to the number of the applications for the patent;
or
b) there is produced to the Controller an
acknowledgement by the person by whom the
assignment or agreement was made that the
assignment or agreement relates to the invention
in respect of which that application is made; or
c) the rights of the claimant in respect of the
invention have been finally established by the
decision of court; or
d) the Controller gives directions for enabling the
application to proceed or for regulating the
manner in which it should be proceeded with
under sub-section (5).
Where one of the two or more joint applicants for
a patent dies at any time before the patent has
been granted, the Controller may upon a request
made by the survivor or survivors and with the
consent of the legal representative of the
deceased direct that the application shall
proceed in the name of the survivor or survivors
alone.
If any dispute arises between joint applicants for
a patent whether or in what manner the
application should be proceeded with, the
Controller may upon an application made by any
of the parties, and after giving to all parties
concerned an opportunity of being heard, give
such directions as he thinks fit for enabling the
application to proceed in the name of one or
more of the parties alone or for regulating the
manner in which it should be proceeded with.
Time for Putting Application in Order for grant
Section 21 of the Act provides that an
application for a patent shall be deemed to have
been abandoned unless, the applicant has
complied within the prescribed period with all the
requirements imposed on him by or under the
Act, whether in connection with the complete
specification or otherwise in relation to the
application from the date on which the first
statement of objections to the application or
complete specification or other documents
related thereto is forwarded to the applicant by
the Controller.
Explanation to section 21(1) clarifies that where
the application for a patent or any specification
or, in the case of a convention application or an
application filed under the PCT designating India
any document filed as part of the application has
been returned to the applicant by the Controller
in the course of the proceedings, the applicant
shall not be deemed to have complied with such
requirements unless and until he has re-filed it or
the applicant proves to the satisfaction of the
Controller that for the reasons beyond his control
such document could not be re-filed.
Sub-section (2) of Section 21 provides that if at
the expiration of the period as prescribed under
sub-section (1) an appeal to the High Court is
pending in respect of the application for the
patent for the main invention; or in the case of
an application for a patent of addition, an appeal
to the High Court is pending in respect of either
that application or the application for the main
invention, the time within which the requirements
of the Controller shall be complied with shall, on
an application made by the applicant before the
expiration of the period as prescribed under sub-
section (1), be extended until such date as the
High Court may determine. In case, the time
within which the appeal mentioned in sub-section
(2) may be instituted has not expired, the
Controller may extend the period as prescribed
under sub-section (1), to such further period as
he may determine. However, in case of an
appeal filed during the said further period, and
the High Court has granted any extension of time
for complying with the requirements of the
Controller, then the requirements may be
complied with within the time granted by the
Court.
OPPOSITION TO THE PATENT
Section 25 of the Act deals with opposition to
grant of patent and provides that where an
application for a patent has been published but a
patent has not been granted, any person may, in
writing, represent by way of opposition to the
Controller against the grant of patent on the
following grounds and the Controller on request
of such person shall hear him and dispose of the
representation in the prescribed manner and
specified time:
(a) that the applicant for the patent or the person
under or through whom he claims, wrongfully
obtained the invention or any part thereof from
him or from a person under or through whom he
claims;
(b) that the invention so far as claimed in any
claim of the complete specification has been
published before the priority date of the claim -
(i) in any specification filed in pursuance of an
application for a patent made in India on or after
the 1st day of January, 1912; or
(ii) in India or elsewhere, in any other document.
Provided that the ground specified in sub-clause
(ii) shall not be available where such publication
does not constitute an anticipation of the
invention by virtue of sub-section (2) or sub-
section (3) of section 29;
(c) that the invention so far as claimed in any
claim of the complete specification is claimed in
a claim of a complete specification published on
or after the priority date of the applicant's claim
and filed in pursuance of an application for a
patent in India, being a claim of which the priority
date is earlier than that of the applicant's claim;
(d) that the invention so far as claimed in any
claim of the complete specification was publicly
known or publicly used in India before the priority
date of that claim.
Explanation - For the purposes of this clause, an
invention relating to a process for which a patent
is claimed shall be deemed to have been
publicly known or publicly used in India before
the priority date of the claim if a product made by
that process had already been imported into
India before that date except where such
importation has been for the purpose of
reasonable trial or experiment only;
(e) that the invention so far as claimed in any
claim of the complete specification is obvious
and clearly
does not involve any inventive step, having
regard to the matter published as mentioned in
clause (b) or having regard to what was used in
India before the priority date of the applicant's
claim;
(f) that the subject of any claim of the complete
specification is not an invention within the
meaning of this Act, or is not patentable under
this Act;
(g) that the complete specification does not
sufficiently and clearly describe the invention or
the method by which it is to be performed;
(h) that the applicant has failed to disclose to the
Controller the information required by section 8
or has furnished the information which in any
material particular was false to his knowledge;
(i) that in the case of convention application, the
application was not made within twelve months
from the date of the first application for
protection for the invention made in a convention
country by the applicant or a person from whom
he derives title;
(j) that the complete specification does not
disclose or wrongly mention the source of
geographical origin of biological material used
for the invention;
(k) that the invention so far as claimed in any
claim of the complete specification is anticipated
having regard to the knowledge, oral or
otherwise, available within any local or
indigenous community in India or elsewhere.
Section 25(2) entitles any interested person to
give notice of opposition, to the Controller in the
prescribed manner at any time after the grant of
patent but before the expiry of a period of one
year from the date of publication of grant of a
patent, on any of the following grounds only :-
(a) that the patentee or the person under or
through whom he claims, wrongfully obtained
the invention or any part thereof from him or from
a person under or through whom he claims;
(b) that the invention so far as claimed in any
claim of the complete specification has been
published before the priority date of the claim in
any specification filed in pursuance of an
application for a patent made in India on or after
the 1st day of January, 1912; or in India or
elsewhere, in any other document. However, the
ground that the invention so far claimed in any
claim of complete specification has been
published before the priority date of the claim in
India or elsewhere in any other document shall
not be available where such publication does not
constitute an anticipation of the invention by
virtue of section 29(2) or (3);
(c) that the invention so far as claimed in any
claim of the complete specification is claimed in
a claim of a complete specification published on
or after the priority date of the claim of the
patentee and filed in pursuance of an application
for a patent in India, being a claim of which the
priority date is earlier than that of the claim of the
patentee;
(d) that the invention so far as claimed in any
claim of the complete specification was publicly
known or publicly used in India before the priority
date of that claim;
It may be noted that an invention relating to a
process for which a patent is granted shall be
deemed to have been publicly known or publicly
used in India before the priority date of the claim
if a product made by that process had already
been imported into India before that date except
where such importation has been for the purpose
of reasonable trial or experiment only;
(e) that the invention so far as claimed in any
claim of the complete specification is obvious
and clearly
does not involve any inventive step, having
regard to the matter published as mentioned in
clause (b) or having regard to what was used in
India before the priority date of the claim;
(f) that the subject of any claim of the complete
specification is not an invention within the
meaning of this Act, or is not patentable under
this Act;
(g) that the complete specification does not
sufficiently and clearly describe the invention or
the method by which it is to be performed;
(h) that the patentee has failed to disclose to the
Controller the information required by section 8
or has furnished the information which in any
material particular was false to his knowledge;
(i) that in the case of a patent granted on
convention application, the application for patent
was not made within twelve months from the
date of the first application for protection for the
invention made in a convention country or in
India by the patentee or a person from whom he
derives title;
(j) that the complete specification does not
disclose or wrongly mentions the source and
geographical origin of biological material used
for the invention;
(k) that the invention so far as claimed in any
claim of the complete specification was
anticipated having regard to the knowledge, oral
or otherwise, available within any local or
indigenous community in India or elsewhere.
Constitution of Opposition board and its
proceeding
Section 25(3) provides that where any such
notice of opposition is duly given under sub-
section (2), the Controller shall notify the
patentee and constitute a Board by order in
writing to be known as the Opposition Board
consisting of such officers as he may determine
and refer such notice of opposition alongwith the
documents to that Board for examination and
submission of its recommendation. Every
Opposition Board is required to conduct the
examination in accordance with the prescribed
procedure. Sub-section (4) provides that the
Controller shall on receipt of the
recommendation of the Opposition Board and
after giving the patentee and the opponent an
opportunity of being heard, order either to
maintain or amend or revoke the patent.
However, the Controller while passing the order
shall not take into account any personal
document or secret trial or secret use in case the
opposition is based on the grounds mentioned
under sub-section (2)(d) & (e). In case the
Controller issues an order under sub-section (4)
that the patent shall be maintained subject to
amendment of the specification or any other
document, the patent shall stand amended
accordingly.
Controller to Treat Application as Application of
Opponent
Section 26 of the Act provides that where in any
opposition proceeding the Controller finds that
the invention, so far as claimed in any claim of
the complete specification, was obtained from
the opponent in the manner set out in section
25(2)(a) and revokes the patent on that ground,
he may, on request by such opponent made in
the prescribed manner, direct that the patent
shall stand amended in the name of the
opponent; or a part of an invention described in
the complete specification was so obtained from
the opponent, he may pass an order requiring
that the specification be amended by the
exclusion of that part of the invention.
Where an opponent has, before the date of the
order of the Controller requiring the amendment
of a complete specification referred to in section
26(1)(b), filed an application for a patent for an
invention which included the whole or a part of
the invention held to have been obtained from
him and such application is pending, the
Controller may treat such application and
specification in so far as they relate to the
invention held to have been obtained from him,
as having been filed, for the purposes of the
priority dates of claims of the complete
specification, on the date on which the
corresponding document was or deemed to have
been filed by the patentee in the earlier
application but for all other purposes the
application of the opponent shall be proceeded
with as an application for a patent.
RESIDENTS NOT TO APPLY FOR PATENTS
OUTSIDE INDIA WITHOUT PRIOR
PERMISSION
Section 39 of the Act provides that no person
resident in India shall, except under the authority
of a written permit sought in the prescribed
manner and granted by or on behalf of the
Controller, make or cause to be made any
application outside India for the grant of a patent
for an invention unless an application for a
patent for the same invention has been made in
India, not less than six weeks before the
application outside India and either no direction
has been given under of section 35(1) in relation
to the application in India, or all such directions
have been revoked.
Sub-section (2) obliges the Controller to dispose
of every such application within the prescribed
period. However, if the invention is relevant for
defence purpose or atomic energy, the Controller
shall not grant permit without the prior consent of
the Central Government. Sub-section (3) clarifies
that the provisions of section 39 shall not apply
in relation to an invention for which an
application for protection has first been filed in a
country outside India by a person resident
outside India.
gRANT OF PATENTS
Section 43 dealing with grant of patents provides
that where an application for a patent has been
found to be in order for grant of the patent and
either the application has not been refused by
the Controller by virtue of any power vested in
him by the Act; or the application has not been
found to be in contravention of any of the
provisions of the Act, the patent shall be granted
as expeditiously as possible to the applicant or,
in the case of a joint application, to the
applicants jointly, with the seal of the patent
office and the date on which the patent is
granted shall be entered in the register. The
Controller has been put under obligation to
publish the fact that the patent has been granted
and thereupon the application, specification and
other documents related thereto shall be open
for public inspection.
grant of Patents Subject to Conditions
Section 47 dealing with grant of patents subject
to conditions provides that the grant of a patent
shall be subject to the conditions that:
(1) any machine, apparatus or other article in
respect of which the patent is granted or any
article made by using a process in respect of
which the patent is granted, may be imported or
made by or on behalf of the Government for the
purpose merely of its own use;
(2) any process in respect of which the patent is
granted may be used by or on behalf of the
Government for the purpose merely of its own
use;
(3) any machine, apparatus or other article in
respect of which the patent is granted or any
article made by the use of the process in respect
of which the patent is granted, may be made or
used, and any process in respect of which the
patent is granted may be used by any person,
for the purpose merely of experiment or research
including the imparting of instructions to pupils;
and
(4) in the case of a patent in respect of any
medicine or drug, the medicine or drug may be
imported by the Government for the purpose
merely of its own use or for distribution in any
dispensary, hospital or other medical institution
maintained by or on behalf of the Government or
any other dispensary, hospital or other medical
institution which the Central Government may,
having regard to the public service that such
dispensary, hospital or medical institution
renders, specify in this behalf by notification in
the Official Gazette.
Rights of Patentees
Section 48 provides that subject to the other
provisions contained in the Patents Act and the
conditions specified in section 47, a patent
granted under the Act shall confer upon the
patentee:
(a) where the subject matter of the patent is a
product, the exclusive right to prevent third
parties, who do not have his consent, from the
act of making, using, offering for sale, selling or
importing for those purposes that product in
India;
(b) where the subject matter of the patent is a
process, the exclusive right to prevent third
parties, who do not have his consent, from the
act of using that process, and from the act of
using, offering for sale, selling or importing for
those purposes the product obtained directly by
that process in India.
What are the Rights of a Patentee once the
Patent is Granted?
A patentee enjoys the exclusive right to make
and use the patented invention. The patentee
also has the right to assign the patent, grant
licences, or otherwise deal with the patent, for
any consideration. These rights, created by
statute, are circumscribed by various conditions
and limitations as prescribed under the Patents
Act, 1970.
Term of Patent
According to Section 53 of the Act, the term of
every patent which has not expired and has not
ceased to have effect, on the date of such
commencement shall be twenty years from the
date of filing of the application for the patent.
The term of patent in case of International
applications filed under the Patent Cooperation
Treaty designating India, shall be twenty years
from the international filing date accorded under
the Patent Cooperation Treaty.
A patent shall cease to have effect
notwithstanding anything therein or in the Act on
the expiration of the period prescribed for the
payment of any renewal fee, if that fee is not
paid within the prescribed period or within such
extended period as may be prescribed.
Notwithstanding anything contained in any other
law for the time being in force, on cessation of
the patent right due to non-payment of renewal
fee or on the expiry of the term of patent, the
subject matter covered by the said patent shall
not be entitled to any protection.
What is the Term of a Patent in the Indian
System?
The term of every patent granted is 20 years
from the date of filing of application. However,
for application filed under national phase under
Patent Cooperation Treaty (PCT), the term of
patent will be 20 years from the international
filing date accorded under PCT.
PATENTS OF ADDITION
Section 54, 55 and 56 deals with patents of
addition. Section 54 provides that where an
application is made for a patent in respect of any
improvement in or modification of an invention
described or disclosed in the complete
specification, namely the main invention and the
applicant also applies or has applied for a patent
for that invention or is the patentee in respect
thereof, the Controller may, if the applicant so
requests, grant the patent for the improvement
or modification as a patent of addition. Where an
invention being an improvement in or
modification of another invention, is the subject
of an independent patent and the patentee in
respect of that patent is also the patentee in
respect of the patent for the main invention, the
Controller may, if the patentee so requests,
revoke the patent for the improvement or
modification and grant to the patentee a patent
of addition in respect thereof, bearing the same
date of the patent so revoked. However a patent
shall not be granted as a patent of addition
unless the date of filing of the application is the
same as or later than the date of filing of the
application in respect of the main invention. A
patent of addition shall not be granted before the
grant of the patent for the main invention.

Section 55 deals with term of patents of addition
and provides that a patent of addition is granted
for a term equal to that of the patent for the main
invention or so much thereof as has not expired
and remains in force during that term or until the
previous cessor of the patent for the main
invention and no longer. No renewal fees is
payable in respect of a patent of addition, but if
any such patent becomes an independent patent
the same fees shall thereafter be payable upon
the same dates, as if the patent had been
originally granted as an independent patent.
Section 56 which deals with validity of patents of
addition provides that the grant of a patent of
addition shall not be refused and a patent
granted as a patent of addition shall not be
revoked or invalidated, on the ground only that
the invention claimed in the complete
specification does not involve any inventive step
having regard to any publication or use of the
main invention described in the complete
specification relating thereto; or any
improvement in or modification of the main
invention described in the complete specification
of a patent of addition to the patent for the main
invention or of an application for such a patent of
addition, and the validity of a patent of addition
shall not be questioned on the ground that the
invention ought to have been the subject of an
independent patent. In this context, it is clarified
that in determining the novelty of the invention
claimed in the complete specification filed in
pursuance of an application for a patent of
addition regard shall be had also to the complete
specification in which the main invention is
described.
A patent of addition application cannot be
rejected on the grounds that the disclosure in the
primary application or patent lacked innovative
step. However, the disclosure in the main
application or patent may be used as evidence
of innovation against the patent addition
application.
In the matter of Ravi Kamal Bali v/s Kala Tech
and others the Bombay High Court on 12th
February, 2008 dismissed the defendant's
arguments that Patent of addition can only be
granted if it has an inventive step over the main
application.
RESTORATION OF LAPSED PATENTS
Section 60 provides that where a patent has
ceased to have effect by reason of failure to pay
any renewal fee within the period prescribed
under section 53 or within period as may be
allowed under section 142(4), the patentee or his
legal representative and where the patent was
held by two or more persons jointly, then with the
leave of the Controller one or more of them
without joining the others, may within eighteen
months from the date on which the patent
ceased to have effect, make an application for
the restoration of the patent.
Procedure for disposal of applications for
restoration of lapsed patents
Section 61 provides that if, after hearing the
applicant in cases where the applicant so desires
or the Controller thinks fit, the Controller is prima
facie satisfied that the failure to pay the renewal
fee was unintentional and that there has been no
undue delay in the making of the application, he
shall publish the application in the prescribed
manner; and within the prescribed period, any
person interested may give notice to the
Controller of opposition thereto on either or both
of the following grounds that - (a) the failure to
pay the renewal fee was not unintentional; or

                                                              there has been
                                                              undue delay in the
                                                              making of the
                                                        (b)   application.
If notice of opposition is given within the
prescribed period aforesaid, the Controller shall
notify the applicant, and shall give to him and to
the opponent an opportunity to be heard before
deciding the case. If no notice of opposition is
given within the prescribed period aforesaid or if
in the case of opposition, the decision of the
Controller is in favour of the applicant, the
Controller shall, upon payment of any unpaid
renewal fee and such additional fee as may be
prescribed, restore the patent and any patent of
addition specified in the application which has
ceased to have effect on the cesser of that
patent. The Controller may, if he thinks fit as a
condition of restoring the patent, require that an
entry shall be made in the register of any
document or matter which has to be entered in
the register but which has not been so entered.
Rights of patentees of lapsed patents which
have been restored
Section 62 provides that where a patent is
restored, the rights of the patentee shall be
subject to such conditions as may be prescribed
and to such other conditions as the Controller
thinks fit to impose for the protection or
compensation of persons who may have begun
to avail themselves of, or have taken definite
steps by contract or otherwise to avail
themselves of, the patented invention between
the date when the patent ceased to have effect
and the date of the publication of the application
for restoration of the patent. No suit or other
proceeding shall be commenced or prosecuted
in respect of an infringement of a patent
committed between the date on which the patent
ceased to have effect and the date of the
publication of the application for restoration of
the patent.
SURRENDER AND REvOCATION OF
PATENTS
Section 63 entitles the patentee to offer to
surrender his patent, at any time by giving notice
to the Controller. Where such an offer is made,
the Controller shall publish the offer in the
prescribed manner and also notify every person
other than the patentee whose name appears in
the register as having an interest in the patent.
Any person interested may, within the prescribed
period after such publication, give notice of
opposition to the Controller and where such
notice in given the Controller shall notify the
patentee. If the Controller is satisfied after
hearing the patentee and any opponent, if
desirous of being heard, that the patent may
properly be surrendered, he may accept the offer
and by order revoke the patent.
grounds for Revocation of Patents
Section 64 deals with revocation of patents. A
patent may be revoked on any of the following
grounds:
* where an invention as claimed in a valid claim
of earlier priority date which is included in the
complete specification of another patent granted
in India;
* where the patent application was filed by a
person who is not entitled under the provisions
of the Act and was granted a patent on such
application;
* where the patent was wrongfully obtained and
the rights of the petitioner or any person
under/through whom he claims, were
contravened;
* when the subject of a claim of the complete
specification is not an invention within the
meaning of the Act;
* where the invention that is being claimed is not
new having regard to what was publicly known or
used in India before the priority date of the claim
and also having regard to what was published in
any of the documents, whether in India or
elsewhere;
* where the invention that is claimed is obvious
and lacks any inventive step, having regard to
what was publicly known, used or published in
India, before the priority date of the claim;
* where the invention is not useful;
* where the invention and the method by which it
is to be performed is not sufficiently and fairly
described by the complete specification. In other
words, the description of the method or the
instructions for the working of the invention as
specified in the complete specification are
insufficient to enable a person of average skill
and knowledge of the art to which the invention
relates, to operate or work the invention or where
the best method of performing the invention
which is known to the applicant is not disclosed;
* where the scope of any claim is not defined
properly or based on the matter which his not
disclosed in the specification;
* where a false suggestion or representation was
made to obtain the patent;
                                                                                              ? where the

                                                                                              not been

                                                                                              the applicant of
                                                                                              the patent to
                                                                                              the Controller
                                                                         the invention that or the

Section 35 has been contravened by the
applicant or made an application in
contravention of Section 39 for the grant of a
patent outside India;
* where the permission to amend the complete
specification under Section 57 or 58 was
obtained by fraud;
* the complete specification does not disclose or
mentions the wrong source or geographical
origin of biological material used for the
invention;
* the invention was anticipated having regard to
the knowledge which was available within any
local or indigenous community within India or
elsewhere.

product that is made by a process which is
claimed, the importation of the product which is
made abroad by that process into India will
constitute knowledge or use in India of the
invention, on the date of importation. Except
where the product has been imported for the
purpose of reasonable trial or experiment only.
Furthermore, on a petition of the Central
Government, the High Court may revoke a
patent if it is satisfied that the patentee has failed
to comply with the request of the Central
Government, without any reasonable cause to
make, use or exercise the invention which has
been granted a patent for the Government's
purpose, within the meaning of Section 99 of the
Act. The petition for revocation of a patent
should be notified to all persons mentioned in the
register who are proprietors of that patent or
have a share or interest in the patent.
Section 65 deals with revocation of patent and
amendment of complete specification on
directions of the Government in cases relating to
atomic energy and section 66 deals with
revocation of patents in public interest. Section
65 provides that where at any time after grant of
a patent, the Central Government is satisfied that
a patent is for an invention relating to atomic
energy for which no patent can be granted under
sub-section (1) of section 20 of the Atomic
Energy Act, 1962, it may direct the Controller to
revoke the patent, and thereupon the Controller,
after giving notice, to the patentee and every
other person whose name has been entered in
the register as having an interest in the patent,
and after giving them an opportunity of being
heard, may revoke the patent. Sub-section 2
empowers the Controller allow the patentee to
amend the complete specification in such
manner as he considers necessary instead of
revoking the patent.
WORKINg OF PATENTED INvENTIONS -
gENERAL PRINCIPLES
Section 83 dealing with general principles
applicable to working of patented invention
provides that in exercising the powers conferred
for working of patents and compulsory licences,
regard shall be had to the following general
considerations, namely:
a) that patents are granted to encourage
inventions and to secure that the inventions are
worked in India on a commercial scale and to the
fullest extent that is reasonably practicable
without undue delay;
b) that they are not granted merely to enable
patentees to enjoy a monopoly for the
importation of the patented article;
                                                       It may be noted
                                                       that Section 2(1)
                                                       (o) of the Act
                                                       defines the term
                                                       patented article
                                                       and patented
                                                       process as to
                                                       mean respectively
                                                       an article or
                                                       process in respect
                                                       of which a patent
                                                       is in force;
c) that the protection and enforcement of patent
rights contribute to the promotion of
technological innovation and to the transfer and
dissemination of technology, to the mutual
advantage of producers and users of
technological knowledge and in a manner
conducive to social and economic welfare, and
to a balance of rights and obligations;
d) that patents granted do not impede protection
of public health and nutrition and should act as
instrument to promote public interest specially in
sectors of vital importance for socio-economic
and technological development of India;
e) that patents granted do not in any way prohibit
Central Government in taking measures to
protect public health;
f) that the patent right is not abused by the
patentee or person deriving title or interest on
patent from the patentee, and the patentee or a
person deriving title or interest on patent from
the patentee does not resort to practices which
unreasonably restrain trade or adversely affect
the international transfer of technology; and
g) that patents are granted to make the benefit of
the patented invention available at reasonably
affordable prices to the public.
COMPULSORY LICENCES
Compulsory licenses are authorizations given to
a third-party by the Controller General to make,
use or sell a particular product or use a particular
process which has been patented, without the
need of the permission of the patent owner. This
concept is recognised at both national as well as
international levels, with express mention in both
(Indian) Patent Act, 1970 and TRIPS Agreement.
There are certain pre-requisite conditions, given
under sections 84-92, which need to be fulfilled if
a compulsory license is to be granted in favour
of someone.
Section 84 provides that at any time after the
expiration of three years from the date of the
grant of a patent, any person interested may
make an application to the Controller for grant of
compulsory licence on patent on any of the
following grounds, namely:
a) that the reasonable requirements of the public
with respect to the patented invention have not
been satisfied, or
b) that the patented invention is not available to
the public at a reasonably affordable price, or
c) that the patented invention is not worked in the
territory of India.
An application for compulsory licence may be
made by any person notwithstanding that he is
already the holder of a licence under the patent
and no person shall be estopped from alleging
that the reasonable requirements of the public
with respect to the patented invention are not
satisfied or that the patented invention is not
worked in the territory of India or that the
patented invention is not available to the public
at a reasonably affordable price by reason of any
admission made by him, whether in such a
licence or otherwise or by reason of his having
accepted such a licence.
Sub-section (3) requires every application for
compulsory licence to contain a statement
setting out the nature of the applicant's interest
together with such particulars as may be
prescribed and the facts upon which the
application is based. The Controller on being
satisfied that the reasonable requirements of the
public with respect to the patented invention
have not been satisfied or the patented invention
is not worked in the territory of India or the
patented invention is not available to the public
at a reasonably affordable price, may grant a
licence upon such terms as he may deem fit.
In considering the application of compulsory
licence, the Controller is required to take into
account -
(i) the nature of the invention, the time which has
elapsed since the sealing of the patent and the
measures already taken by the patentee or any
licencee to make full use of the invention;
(ii) the ability of the applicant to work the
invention to the public advantage;
(iii) the capacity of the applicant to undertake the
risk in providing capital and working the
invention, if the application were granted;
(iv) as to whether the applicant has made efforts
to obtain a licence from the patentee on
reasonable terms and conditions and such
efforts have not been successful within a
reasonable period as the Controller may deem
fit.

It may be noted that above stated point (i) to (iv)
shall not be applicable in case of national
emergency or other circumstances of extreme
urgency or in case of public non-commercial use
or on establishment of a ground of anti-
competitive practices adopted by the patentee.
However, the Controller is under no obligation to
take into account matters subsequent to the
making of the application. It has been clarified
that the reasonable period shall be construed as
a period not ordinarily exceeding a period of six
months. In this context, it has been clarified that,
the reasonable requirements of the public shall
be deemed not to have been satisfied if -
(a) by reason of the refusal of the patentee to
grant a licence or licences on reasonable terms,-
(i) an existing trade or industry or the
development thereof or the establishment of any
new trade or industry in India or the trade or
industry in India or the trade or industry of any
person or class of persons trading or
manufacturing in India is prejudiced; or
(ii) the demand for the patented article has not
been met to an adequate extent or on
reasonable terms; or
(iii) a market for export of the patented article
manufactured in India is not being supplied or
developed; or
(iv) the establishment or development of
commercial activities in India is prejudiced; or
(b) by reason of conditions imposed by the
patentee upon the grant of licences under the
patent or upon the purchase, hire or use of the
patented article or process, the manufacture, use
or sale of materials not protected by the patent,
or the establishment or development of any trade
or industry in India, is prejudiced; or
(c) the patentee imposes a condition upon the
grant of licences under the patent to provide
exclusive grant back, prevention to challenges to
the validity of patent or coercive package
licensing; or
(d) the patented invention is not being worked in
the territory of India on a commercial scale to an
adequate extent or is not being so worked to the
fullest extent that is reasonably practicable; or
(e) the working of the patented invention in the
territory of India on a commercial scale is being
prevented or hindered by the importation from
abroad of the patented article by -
(i) the patentee or persons claiming under him; or
(ii) persons directly or indirectly purchasing from
him; or
(iii) other persons against whom the patentee is
not taking or has not taken proceedings for
infringement.
Revocation of Patents by the Controller for Non-
Working
Section 85 deals with revocation of patents by
Controller for non-working and provides that
where, in respect of a patent, a compulsory
licence has been granted, the Central
Government or any person interested may, after
the expiration of two years from the date of the
order granting the first compulsory licence, apply
to the Controller for an order revoking the patent
on the ground that the patented invention has
not been worked in the territory of India or
reasonable requirements of the public with
respect to the patented invention has not been
satisfied or the patented invention is not
available to the public at a reasonably affordable
price.
Every application for revocation should contain
prescribed particulars, the facts upon which the
application is based, and, in the case of an
application other than by the Central
Government, should also set out the nature of
the applicant's interest. The Controller, if
satisfied that the reasonable requirements of the
public with respect to the patented invention has
not been satisfied or patented invention has not
been worked in the territory of India or is not
available to the public at a reasonably affordable
price, may make an order revoking the patent.
The controller has however been put under
obligation to ordinarily decide such application
within one year of its presentation.

Procedure for Dealing with Applications
Section 87 provides that where the Controller is
satisfied, upon consideration of an application for
compulsory licence or revocation of patent, that
a prima facie case has been made out for the
making of an order, he shall direct the applicant
to serve copies of the application upon the
patentee and any other person appearing from
the register to be interested in the patent in
respect of which the application is made, and
shall publish the application in the Official
Journal.
The patentee or any other person desiring to
oppose the application may, within prescribed
time or within such further time as the Controller
may on application allow, give to the Controller
notice of opposition. Any such notice of
opposition should contain a statement setting out
the grounds on which the application is opposed.
Where any such notice of opposition is duly
given, the Controller shall notify the applicant,
and shall give to the applicant and the opponent
an opportunity to be heard before deciding the
case.
Powers of Controller in granting compulsory
licences
Section 88 provides that where the Controller is
satisfied that the manufacture, use or sale of
materials not protected by the patent is
prejudiced by reason of conditions imposed by
the patentee upon the grant of licences under the
patent, or upon the purchase, hire or use of the
patented article or process, he may order the
grant of licences under the patent to such
customers of the applicant as he thinks fit as well
as to the applicant. Where an application for
compulsory licence is made under Section 84 by
a person being the holder of a licence under the
patent, the Controller may, if he makes an order
for the grant of a licence to the applicant, order
the existing licence to be cancelled, or may, if he
thinks fit, instead of making an order for the grant
of a licence to the applicant, order the existing
licence to be amended.
Where two or more patents are held by the same
patentee and an applicant for a compulsory
licence establishes that the reasonable
requirements of the public have not been
satisfied with respect to only some of the said
patents, then, if the Controller is satisfied that the
applicant cannot efficiently or satisfactorily work
the licence granted to him under those patents
without infringing the other patents held by the
patentee and if those patents involve important
technical advancement or considerable
economic significance in relation to the other
patents, he may, by order, direct the grant of a
licence in respect of the other patents also to
enable the licencee to work the patent or patents
in regard to which a licence is granted under
Section 84.
Where the terms and conditions of a licence
have been settled by the Controller, the licencee
may, at any time after he has worked the
invention on a commercial scale for a period of
not less than twelve months, make an
application to the Controller for the revision of
the terms and conditions on the ground that the
terms and conditions settled have proved to be
more onerous than originally expected and that
in consequence thereof the licencee is unable to
work the invention except at a loss. However no
such application shall be entertained a second
time by the Controller.
Termination of compulsory licence
Section 94 provides that on an application made
by the patentee or any other person deriving title
or interest in the patent, a compulsory licence
may be terminated by the Controller, provided
the circumstances that give rise to the grant
thereof no longer exist and such circumstances
are unlikely to recur. In this regard the holder of
the compulsory licence has been entitled to
object to such termination.
International Arrangements
Section 133 to 139 deal with international
arrangements. Section 133 deals with
convention countries; section 134 deals with
notification as to countries not providing for
reciprocity; section 135 provides for convention
applications; section 136 contains special
provisions relating to convention applications;
section 137 provides for multiple priorities;
section 138 deals with supplementary provisions
as to convention applications; and section 139
provides for application of other provisions of the
Act to convention applications.
In terms of Section 133 a convention country is
that country, which is a signatory or party or a
group of countries, union of countries or
intergovernmental organizations which are
signatories or parties to an international, regional
or bi-lateral treaty, convention or arrangement to
which India is also a signatory or party and which
affords to the applicants for patents in India or to
citizens of India similar privileges as are granted
to their own citizens or citizens to their member
countries in respect of the grant of patents and
protection of patent rights. Section 134 provides
that where any country notified by the Central
Government as Convention Country does not
accord to citizens of India the same rights in
respect of the grant of patents and the protection
of patent rights as it accords to its own nationals,
no national of such country shall be entitled
either solely or jointly with any other person:
a) to apply for the grant of a patent or be
registered as the proprietor of a patent;
b) to be registered as the assignee of the
proprietor of a patent; or
c) to apply for a licence or hold any licence under
a patent granted under the Act.
Section 135(1) provides that where a person has
made an application for a patent in respect of an
invention in a convention country (basic
application) and that person or legal
representative or assignee of that person makes
an application under the Act for a patent within
twelve months after the date on which the basic
application was made, the priority date of a claim
of the complete specification being a claim
based on matter disclosed in the basic
application, is the date of making of the basic
application.
The explanation to Section 135(1) clarifies that
where applications have been made for similar
protection in respect of an invention in two or
more convention countries, the period of twelve
months shall be reckoned from the date on
which the earlier or earliest of the said
applications was made.
In case of an application filed under the Patent
Cooperation Treaty designating India and
claiming priority from a previously filed
application in India, the provisions of sub-
sections (1) and (2) shall apply as if the
previously filed application were the basic
application. However, a request for examination
under section 11B shall be made only for one of
the applications filed in India.
Section 136 containing special provisions
relating to convention applications requires every
convention application to be accompanied by a
complete specification; and specify the date on
which and the convention country in which the
application for protection, or as the case may be,
the first of such application was made; and to
state that no application for protection in respect
of the invention had been made in a convention
country before that date by the applicant or by
any person from whom he derives title.
A complete specification filed with a convention
application may include claims in respect of
developments of, or additions to, the invention in
respect of which the application for protection
was made in a convention country, being
developments or additions in respect of which
the applicant would be entitled under the
provisions of Section 6 to make a separate
application for a patent. Sub-section (3) prohibits
a convention application to be post-dated to a
date later than the date on which the application
could have been made under the Act.
Section 138 requires the applicant of a
convention application to furnish, in addition to
the complete specification, copies of the
specifications or corresponding documents filed
or deposited by the applicant in the patent office
of the convention country and verified to the
satisfaction of the Controller within the
prescribed period from the date of
communication by the Controller. If any such
specification or other document is in a foreign
language, a translation into english of the
specification or document verified by affidavit or
otherwise to the satisfaction of the Controller are

LESSON ROUND-UP
* A Patent is a statutory right for an invention
granted for a limited period of time to the
patentee by the Government, in exchange of full
disclosure of his invention for excluding others,
from making, using, selling, importing the
patented product or process for producing that
product for those purposes without his consent.
* The law relating to patents contained in the
Patents Act, 1970 has been amended in the year
1995, 1999, 2002 and 2005 to meet India's
obligations under the agreement on Trade
Related Aspects of Intellectual Property Rights
(TRIPs) forming part of the Agreement
establishing the World Trade Organisation
(WTO).
* Invention as to mean a new product or process
involving an inventive step and capable of
Industrial application.
* Inventive step as to mean a feature of an
invention that involves technical advance as
compared to the existing knowledge or having
economic significance or both that makes the
invention not obvious to a person skilled in the
art.
* Provisional specification describes the nature
of the invention to have the priority date of filing
of the application in which the inventive idea has
been disclosed. It must be followed by a
complete specification describing the details of
the invention along with a statement of claims
within 12 months after filing of the provisional
application. If the complete specification is not
filed within the prescribed period, the application
is treated as deemed to have been abandoned.
* Generally, an application filed with provisional
specification is known as provisional application
which is useful in establishing a priority date for
your invention. Moreover, filing of a provisional
application is useful as it gives sufficient time to
the applicant to assess and evaluate the market
potential of his invention before filing complete
specification. However, it is not necessary to file
an application with provisional specification and
one can file application directly with complete
specification.

Trade Marks Act, 1999 is an Act to amend and
consolidate the law relating to trade marks, to
provide for registration and better protection of
trade marks for goods and services and for the
prevention of the use of fraudulent marks. It
extends to the whole of India.

INTRODUCTION
A trademark is a sign capable of distinguishing
the goods or services of one enterprise from
those of other enterprises. Trademarks are
protected by intellectual property rights. A trade
mark is a visual symbol which may be a word
signature, name, device, label, numerals or
combination of colours used by one undertaking
on goods or services or other articles of
commerce to distinguish it from other similar
goods or services originating from a different
undertaking. Trademark is a symbol that allows a
purchaser to identify goods or services that have
been proved satisfactory and not to buy goods or
services that have not been satisfactory.
Trademarks help promote economic efficiency. If
trademarks are not allowed to be registered with
the manufacturers it may eventually take away
the incentive of trademark owning manufacturers
to make investments in quality control. There
would thus be no healthy competition among the
manufacturers leading to the loss of vitality of
the economy. If we do not have a system of
having trademark a manufacturer would get
nothing by improving his product's quality. And
consumers would not be in a position to identify
high or low-quality products. In such a situation a
manufacturer who reduce the price by reducing
quality may pocket the benefit of the market. The
consequence would be attempts to produce
inferior quality products rather than competition
to produce better-quality products.
In view of developments in trading and
commercial practices, increasing globalisation of
trade and industry, the need to encourage
investment flows and transfer of technology,
need for simplification and harmonization of
trade mark management systems and to give
effect to important judicial decisions, a new
Trade Marks Act, 1999 have been enacted to
provide for registration of trade mark for goods
as well as services including prohibition to the
registration of imitation of well-known
trademarks, and expansion of grounds for
refusal of registration.
A Trade Mark distinguishes the goods of one
manufacturer or trader from similar goods of
others and therefore, it seeks to protect the
interest of the consumer as well as the trader. A
trade mark may consist of a device depicting the
picture of animals, human beings etc., words,
letters, numerals, signatures or any combination
thereof. Since a trade mark indicates relationship
in the course of trade, between trader and
goods, it serves as a useful medium of
advertisement for the goods and their quality.
The current law of Trade Marks contained in the
Trade Marks Act, 1999 is in harmony with two
major international treaties on the subject,
namely The Paris Convention for Protection of
Industrial Property and TRIPS Agreement to
both of which India is a signatory.


DEFINITIONS AND INTERPRETATIONS
Following are some of the important terms
defined in the Trade Marks Act
Trade Mark
The term trade mark has been defined under
Section 2(1)(zb) of the Act as to mean a mark
capable of being represented graphically and
which is capable of distinguishing the goods or
services of one person from those of others and
may include shape of goods, their packaging and
combination of colours; and
(i) in relation to Chapter XII (other than section
107), a registered trade mark or a mark used in
relation to goods or services for the purpose of
indicating or so as to indicate a connection in the
course of trade between the goods or services,
as the case may be, and some person having
the right as proprietor to use the mark; and
(ii) in relation to other provisions of this Act, a
mark used or proposed to be used in relation to
goods or services for the purpose of indicating or
so to indicate a connection in the course of trade
between the goods or services, as the case may
be, and some person having the right, either as
proprietor or by way of permitted user, to use the
mark whether with or without any indication of
the identity of that person, and includes a
certification trade mark or collective mark.
What is a Trademark?
A trademark (popularly known as brand name) in
layman's language is a visual symbol which may
be a word signature, name, device, label,
numerals or combination of colours used by one
undertaking on goods or services or other
articles of commerce to distinguish it from other
similar goods or services originating from a
different undertaking.
The essential requirements to register a
trademark under the Act are:

Section 2(1)(e) defines the term certification
trade mark as to mean a mark capable of
distinguishing the goods or services in
connection with which it is used in the course of
trade which are certified by the proprietor of the
mark in respect of origin, material, mode of
manufacture of goods or performance of
services, quality, accuracy or other
characteristics from goods or services not so
certified and registerable as such in respect of
those goods or services in the name, as
proprietor of the certification trade mark, of that
person.
Collective Mark
As per Section 2(1)(g) of the Act, Collective mark
means a trade mark distinguishing the goods or
services of members of an association of
persons (not being a partnership within the
meaning of the Indian Partnership Act, 1932
which is the proprietor of the mark from those of
others.
Well Known Trade Mark
In terms of Section 2(1)(zg), a well-known trade
mark in relation to any goods or services means
a mark which has become so to the substantial
segment of the public which uses such goods or
services such that the use of such mark in
relation to other goods or services would be
likely to be taken as indicating a connection in
the course of trade or rendering of services
between those goods or services and a person
using the mark in relation to the first-mentioned
goods or services.
With coming up of the Trade Mark Rules 2017, a
new procedure has been created that allows the
Registrar to proclaim a particular trademark as
"well known". According to the new rule, a
trademark owner can file an application in form
TM-M with a request made to the Registrar for
declaring the mark to be "well-known". A well-
known trade mark has been vouchsafed with
extraordinary protection and safeguards against
passing off and infringement of such trademarks.
Well-known trademarks are recognised in India
on the basis of their reputation, nationally,
internationally and the cross-borders. Unlike
other trademarks whose goodwill and reputation
is limited to a certain specified geographical area
and to a certain range of products, well-known
trademarks have its goodwill and reputation
protected across the nation and across
categories of goods and services. It is law that
restricts the Trade Mark Registry to allow and
register any mark as a trademark which is
deceptively similar to any of the well-known
trademark.
For Example: Google has been registered as a
well-known trademark of Alphabet Inc., which
thereby means only Alphabet Inc. can register
the term 'Google' for any category of goods and
services. Even if the service is not related to the
Internet industry, no other company but Alphabet
Inc. can register 'Google' as its trademark.
Mark
The term mark under Section 2(1)(m) has been
defined to include a device, brand, heading,
label, ticket, name, signature, word, letter,
numeral, shape of goods, packaging or
combination of colours or any combination
thereof.
Assignment
According to Section 2(1)(b) of the Act,
assignment means an assignment in writing by
act of the parties concerned.
Deceptively Similar
According to Section 2(1) (h) of the Act a mark
shall be deemed to be deceptively similar to
another mark if it so nearly resembles that other
mark as to be likely to deceive or cause
confusion.
Package
In terms of clause (q) of Section 2(1) the term
package include any case, box, container,
covering, folder, receptacle, vessel, casket,
bottle, wrapper, label, band, ticket, reel, frame,
capsule, cap, lid, stopper and cork.
Permitted Use
mark                                                (i)




Section 2(1)(r) defines the term permitted use, in
relation to a registered trade mark, as to mean
the use of trade
by a registered user of the trade mark in relation
to goods or services -
a) with which he is connected in the course of
trade; and
b) in respect of which the trade mark remains
registered for the time being; and
c) for which he is registered as registered user;
and
d) which complies with any conditions or
limitations to which the registration of registered
user is subject; or
                                                      (ii)
by a person other than the registered proprietor
and registered user in relation to goods or
services
a) with which he is connected in the course of
trade; and
b) in respect of which the trade mark remains
registered for the time being; and
c) by consent of such registered proprietor in a
written agreement; and
d) which complies with any conditions or
limitations to which such user is subject and to
which the registration of the trade mark is
subject.
Service
The term service under clause (z) of sub-section
(1) of Section (2) has been defined as to mean
service of any description which is made
available to potential users and includes the
provision of services in connection with business
of any industrial or commercial matters such as
banking, communication, education, financing,
insurance, chit funds, real estate, transport,
storage, material treatment, processing, supply
of electrical or other energy, boarding, lodging,
entertainment, amusement, construction, repair,
conveying of news or information and
advertising.

Procedure for Registration
Section 18 deals with the procedure for making
an application for registration. Any person
claiming to be the Proprietor of a trademark
used or proposed to be used by him, who is
desirous of registering it, shall apply in writing to
the Registrar in the prescribed manner for the
registration of his trademark. Sub-section (2) of
Section 18 allows registration in several classes
of goods or services by means of a single
application. However, the fee payable is to be
calculated on the basis of the number of classes
in which registration is sought.

Section 23 places obligation on the Registrar to
register the trade mark where the procedure for
registration of a trade mark has been completed
viz., the application has been accepted and
either the application has not been opposed or
the opposition has been dismissed.
Processing of TM Application in Trade Mark
Registry
At present processing of Trade Mark application
is done completely through TM electronic
processing System and filing of application is
allowed in hybrid mode, i.e. online as well as
offline. Currently online filing has reached around
98%. Moreover, all applications received offline
get digitized at its initial stage and movement of
the file is done through complete electronic
mode thereafter.
A brief description of stage wise processing in
Trade Mark Registration is as follows - A. Pre-
Examination Processing:
i. Filing of application: A Trade Mark Application
may be filed online or offline. After digitization of
offline applications, both online and offline
applications are merged and proceed further for
processing through the Trade Mark system.
ii. VIENNA Codification: If applied mark consists
of figurative elements, codification of the
figurative elements is done as per VIENNA
Agreement and then application moves for
examination. Trade Marks applied as word per
se directly proceed for examination. It is
expected that all applications which may require
VIENNA Codification or otherwise should be
processed expeditiously and serially as per
priority based on the date of filing of application.
b. Examination of Applications:
It may be noted that allotment of applications for
the examination is done by the automated
system serially on the basis of the date of filing.
Examination in Trade Mark Registration is done
in two stages, first examination report is
prepared by an Examiner and then the
application and examination report is forwarded
to Examination Controller for approval.
Examination Controller evaluates the
examination report, and if found proper,
approves it and thereafter the examination report
is issued to applicant. However, if some
deficiency is noted by the Controller, the
examination report is reverted/referred back to
the concerned Examiner with suggestions for
resubmission/re-examination.
At this stage, application may be accepted or an
objection may be raised as per provisions of the
Trade Mark Act. In case it is accepted, it will be
published in Trade Mark Journal, else
examination report will be issued to the applicant
containing office objections which needs to be
replied by the applicant within 30 days from the
date of receipt of examination report.
It is expected that examination should be done
expeditiously and serially as per priority based
on the date of filing of application or if any
compliances are required, expeditiously and
serially as per priority based the date of last
compliance, if any.
C. Post Examination Processing:
i. Consideration of Reply: After receipt of
examination report, applicant needs to submit his
reply to the office objections within one month
time and if he fails to do so, the application is
abandoned for want of reply.
If reply is submitted within the prescribed period,
the same is considered by the authorized officers
for the purpose. Here also, the application is
allotted to the authorized officers through the
Trade Mark system serially on the basis of the
date of filing of the response to the examination
report. At this stage, the authorized officer may
accept application and the same is to be
published in the Trade Mark Journal. In other
cases, where the office objections cannot be
waived or found not met, a hearing opportunity is
offered to the applicants in all those cases where
a decision can adversely affect the interest of the
applicant, a hearing opportunity is given as per
law.
                                                      It is expected that
                                                      if reply is
                                                      submitted against
                                                      the office
                                                      objections, the
                                                      same should be
                                                      considered by the
                                                      authorized officers
                                                      expeditiously and
                                                      serially as per
                                                      priority based the
                                                      date of filing of
                                                      response to the
                                                      examination
                                                      report.
ii. Show-cause hearing: In case the objection/s
raised by the office are not met after
consideration of reply to the examination report,
the application moves for show cause hearing. In
show cause hearing, the hearing notices are
issued serially to the applicant/ agent through
the system and allotment of the cases to the
Hearing officers is also done by the TM system
automatically.
The scheduling of applications for hearing
should also be done serially based on the date
of consideration of reply by the authorized
officer.
D. Post Advertisement Processing:
After the acceptance of the mark, trademark is
published in Trade Mark Journal. If no opposition
is filed within four months from the date of
publication of the trademark, the published
trademark becomes eligible for registration.
The issuance of registration certificate is done
through automated Trade Mark system. The
certificate gets automatically issued if no
opposition is filed within the prescribed period or
where the application has not already been
withdrawn by the Registrar of Trade Marks at the
request of the applicant.
The Trade Mark once registered is valid for 10
years. The same can be renewed after every 10
years for an indefinite period by paying the
prescribed fee on the prescribed form. E.
Opposition:
If the trademark is opposed by any third party
after the publication, the same needs to be
disposed of as per rules after giving proper
hearing opportunity to both the parties. If the
opposition is dismissed, the trade mark proceeds
for registration and registration certificate is
issued to the applicant. In case opposition is
allowed, the application gets refused as per law.
It is expected that if any application is opposed,
the same should be disposed serially based on
the compliance or non-compliance by the party
(i.e. Applicant or Opponent) as per provisions of
the Trade Marks Act and Rules.
Procedure for disposal of the Rectification
proceedings shall be similar to the opposition
procedure subject to the provisions of the Trade
Marks Act and Rules.

It is possible for the registered proprietor to
record the post registration changes pertaining to
proprietor name, address, address for service,
assignment or registered user, etc. in the
Register of Trade Marks by filing a request on
the prescribed form, with the prescribed fee. In
case the concerned officer examining the
request raises some objections and requires
some compliance on part of the applicant, the
same should be processed ordinarily within 30
days from the date of compliance by the
applicant. It is also a practice of Registry to send
one month notice to previous registered
proprietor in case any change in proprietorship
by way of assignment or transmission is filed by
the applicant. In this case, the request can be
processed only after expiry of one month notice
period as mentioned above.
It is expected that the post registration request
shall be examined and processed serially based
on the date of filing of the request and date of
compliance of the requirements, if any.
The renewal requests received by the Registry
are processed through an automated TM system
serially based on the date of filing of the request.
Trade Mark Registration Workflow Chart

What are the Benefits of Registering a
Trademark?
The registration of a trademark confers upon the
owner the exclusive right to the use the
trademark in relation to the goods or services in
respect of which the mark is registered and to
indicate so by using the symbol (R), and seek
the relief of infringement in appropriate courts in
the country. The exclusive right is however
subject to any conditions entered on the register
such as limitation of area of use etc. Also, where
two or more persons have registered identical or
nearly similar marks due to special
circumstances, such exclusive right does not
operate against each other.
Absolute grounds for Refusal of Registration
Section 9(1) of the Act containing provisions
relating to absolute grounds for refusal for
registration prohibit the registration of those
trademarks
(a) which are devoid of any distinctive character,
that is to say, not capable of distinguishing the
goods or services of one person from those of
another person;
(b) which consist exclusively of marks or
indications which may serve in trade to
designate the kind,
quality, quantity, intended purpose, values,
geographical origin or the time of production of
the goods or rendering of the service or other
characteristics of the goods or service;
(c) which consist exclusively of marks or
indications which have become customary in the
current language or in the bona fide and
established practices of the trade, shall not be
registered: Provided that a trade mark shall not
be refused registration if before the date of
application for registration it has acquired a
distinctive character as a result of the use made
of it or is a well-known trade mark.
In the case of Himalaya Drug Company vs.
S.B.L. Ltd. 2013 (53) PTC 1 (Del.) (DB): the
Appellant had filed a suit against the Respondent
for infringement of trade mark "Liv.52" by use of
the trade mark "Liv-T". The lower court
dismissed the suit of the Appellants holding that
the mark 'LIV' is publici juris and there is no
similarity between the two trademarks. 'Liv' will
be considered as the generic on account of the
fact that it is used in respect of medicine used
for treatment of ailment of 'Liver' and non-
distinctive part of the mark and it is to be ignored
even if the two rival marks are to be taken as a
whole.
The Plaintiffs filed an appeal before the High
Court of Delhi, whereby the High Court reversed
the finding of the lower court and upheld the
principles of Trade Mark law of comparison and
infringement. The court held that the onus of
proving that the term 'LIV' has become generic
lied heavily on the Defendant, more so in the
light of the fact that the Trade Mark of the
Plaintiff had voluminous sales, was being used
since the year 1955 and was registered since the
year 1957 and as seven years had expired from
the date of the registration, the Registration of
the trade mark the trade mark was taken to be
valid as per Section 32 of the erstwhile Trade
Marks Act, 1958.

The Defendant could not prove by way of its
evidence that the word 'LIV' is generic. The
Plaintiff on the other hand proved the
distinctiveness of its mark by way of its evidence
by providing the orders where the mark 'LIV.52'
has been granted protection. The court also
noted that consumer asked for Plaintiff's product
as Liv.52 thus 'LIV' was the essential and
prominent feature of the mark 'LIV.52' and
restrained the Defendant from using the mark
'LIV-T' and the Court allowed the Defendant to
amend its mark accordingly to a mark which will
not be similar to the mark of the Plaintiff.
However, a trademark shall not be refused
registration, if the mark has in fact acquired a
distinctive character as a result of use or is a
well-known trade mark before the date of
application. In short, a trade mark which has
been demonstrated to be distinctive in the
market place shall be regarded as distinctive in
law as well and be registerable.
According to Section 9(2) the following
trademark shall not be registered:
1. If the trademark tends to deceive the public or
cause any confusion;
2. In any instance if the trademark hurts any
religious sentiment of any demographic section
of Indian citizens;
In the case of Amritpal Singh vs. Lal Babu
Priyadarshi , 2005 (30) PTC 94, Intellectual
Property Appellate Board (IPAB) the word
RAMAYAN was refused registration on the
grounds that: Firstly, it was not capable of
distinguishing the goods of the applicant and
Secondly, that it was likely to hurt religious
sentiments of a class of society.
Further, Intellectual Property Appellate Board
referred the case Registrar of Trade Marks v.
Ashok Chandra Rakhit Ltd., AIR 1955 SC 555
where in the Hon'ble Supreme Court in his order
inter alia observed:
(4) It appears that subsequently the Registrar
found that the word Shree" was used by Hindus
as an auspicious symbol and placed even on
letter heads and that consequently it was not
adapted to distinguish within the meaning of the
Act. In course of time, therefore, a practice
became established in the Registry whereby the
word "Shree" was either refused registration as a
trade mark or a disclaimer was enforced if it
were made a part of a trade mark. So inflexible
had been this practice that barring this particular
trade mark No. 3815 there was no other trade
mark containing the word "Shree" which had
been registered without a disclaimer of the word
"Shree". Naturally this circumstance was bound
to be regarded as an invidious discrimination
and, indeed, pointed reference is said to have
been made to it and it was suggested that the
Registry should deal impartially and uniformly
with all applications in matters relating to
practice."
3. It comprises or contains scandalous or
obscene matter;
4. Its use is prohibited under the Emblems and
Names (Prevention of Improper Use) Act, 1950.
Section 9(3) prohibits registration of a mark, if it
consists exclusively of shape of goods which
result from the nature of the goods themselves
or which is necessary to obtain a technical result
or which gives substantial value to the goods. It
is, however, explained that the nature of goods
or services in relation to which the Trade Mark is
used or proposed to be used shall not be a
ground for refusal of registration.
Limitation as to Colour
Section 10 provides that a trade mark may be
limited wholly or in part to any combination of
colours and any such limitation shall be taken
into consideration by the Registrar or the High
Court, as the case may be having to decide on
the distinctive character of the trade mark.
So far as a trade mark is registered without
limitation of colour, it shall be deemed to be
registered for all colours.
Relative grounds for Refusal of Registration
Section 11(1) stipulates that a trade mark shall
not be registered if, because of-
(a) its identity with an earlier trade mark and
similarity of goods or services covered by the
trade mark; or
(b) its similarity to an earlier trade mark and the
identity or similarity of the goods or services
covered by the trade mark, there exists a
likelihood of confusion on the part of the public,
which includes the likelihood of association with
the earlier trade mark.
Section 11 (2) states that a trade mark which (a)
is identical with or similar to an earlier trade
mark; and (b) is to be registered for goods or
services which are not similar to those for which
the earlier trade mark is registered in the name
of a different proprietor, shall not be registered if
or to the extent the earlier trade mark is a
wellknown trade mark in India and the use of the
later mark without due cause would take unfair
advantage of or be detrimental to the distinctive
character or repute of the earlier trade mark.
Section 11 (3) provides that a trade mark shall
not be registered if, or to the extent that, its use
in India is liable to be prevented-
(a) by virtue of any law in particular the law of
passing off protecting an unregistered trade
mark used in the course of trade; or
(b) by virtue of law of copyright.
Section 11(4) states that nnothing in this section
shall prevent the registration of a trade mark
where the proprietor of the earlier trade mark or
other earlier right consents to the registration,
and in such case the Registrar may register the
mark under special circumstances under section
12.
Earlier Trade Mark means-
(a) a registered trade mark or an application
under section 18 bearing an earlier date of filing
or an international registration referred to in
section 36E or convention application referred to
in section 154 which has a date of application
earlier than that of the trade mark in question,
taking account, where appropriate, of the
priorities claimed in respect of the trade marks.
(b) a trade mark which, on the date of the
application for registration of the trade mark in
question, or where appropriate, of the priority
claimed in respect of the application, was
entitled to protection as a well-known trade mark.
As per Section 11 (6) of the Act, the Registrar
shall, while determining whether a trade mark is
a well-known trade mark, take into account any
fact which he considers relevant for determining
a trade mark as a well-known trade mark
including-
(i) the knowledge or recognition of that trade
mark in the relevant section of the public
including knowledge in India obtained as a result
of promotion of the trade mark;
(ii) the duration, extent and geographical area of
any use of that trade mark;
(iii) the duration, extent and geographical area of
any promotion of the trade mark, including
advertising or publicity and presentation, at fairs
or exhibition of the goods or services to which
the trade mark applies;
(iv) the duration and geographical area of any
registration of or any application for registration
of that trade mark under this Act to the extent
that they reflect the use or recognition of the
trade mark;
(v) the record of successful enforcement of the
rights in that trade mark, in particular the extent
to which the trade mark has been recognised as
a well-known trade mark by any court or
Registrar under that record.
Section 11(7) provides that the Registrar shall,
while determining as to whether a trade mark is
known or recognised in a relevant section of the
public for the purposes of sub-section (6), take
into account-
(i) the number of actual or potential consumers
of the goods or services;
(ii) the number of persons involved in the
channels of distribution of the goods or services;
(iii) the business circles dealing with the goods or
services; to which that trade mark applies.
Where a trade mark has been determined to be
well known in at least one relevant section of the
public in India by any court or Registrar, the
Registrar shall consider that trade mark as a
well-known trade mark for registration under this
Act.
The Registrar shall not require as a condition, for
determining whether a trade mark is a well-
known trade mark, any of the following, namely:-
(i) that the trade mark has been used in India;
(ii) that the trade mark has been registered;
(iii) that the application for registration of the
trade mark has been filed in India;
(iv) that the trade mark-
(a) is well-known in; or
(b) has been registered in; or
(c) in respect of which an application for
registration has been filed in, any jurisdiction
other than India, or
(v) that the trade mark is well-known to the public
at large in India.
While considering an application for registration
of a trade mark and opposition filed in respect
thereof, the Registrar shall-
(i) protect a well-known trade mark against the
identical or similar trademarks;
(ii) take into consideration the bad faith involved
either of the applicant or the opponent affecting
the right relating to the trade mark.
Where a trade mark has been registered in good
faith disclosing the material information to the
Registrar or where right to a trade mark has been
acquired through use in good faith before the
commencement of this Act, then, nothing in this
Act shall prejudice the validity of the registration
of that trade mark or right to use that trade mark
on the ground that such trade mark is identical
with or similar to a well-known trade mark.
In the case of Imperial Tobacco Co. of India Ltd.
vs. The Registrar of Trade Marks Calcutta High
Court judgement dated 28 May, 1968, the
Imperial Tobacco Company manufactured and
distributed cigarettes with a label "simla" all over
the country. ITC ltd. made an application to the
Registrar for the registration in the year 1960
and 1966. But both the times the registration
application was refused by the registrar. The
Calcutta High Court rejected the appeal on the
ground that the term "simla" is a famous
geographical place. This term cannot be
registered as a trademark. The trade mark
"Simla" with the label is composite in character.
Its essential feature is the word Simla. ''Simla" is
neither an invented word nor is it a word having
a dictionary meaning. It is a well-known hill-
station of India. Its geographical signification is,
therefore, plain and unequivocal. The snow-clad
hills in outline on the label makes the
geographical significance inescapable.
Prohibition of Registration of Names of Chemical
Elements or International Non-Proprietary
Names
Section 13 states that no word (a) which is the
commonly used and accepted name of any
single chemical element or any single chemical
compound (as distinguished from a mixture) in
respect of a chemical substance or preparation,
or (b) which is declared by the World Health
Organisation and notified in the prescribed
manner by the Registrar from time to time, as an
international non-proprietary name or which is
deceptively similar to such name, shall be
registered as a trade mark and any such
registration shall be deemed for the purpose of
section 57 to be an entry made in the register
without sufficient cause or an entry wrongly
remaining on the register, as the circumstances
may require.
Use of Names and Representations of Living
Persons or Persons Recently Dead
Where an application is made for the registration
of a trade mark which falsely suggests a
connection with any living person, or a person
whose death took place within twenty years prior
to the date of application for registration of the
trade mark, the Registrar may, before he
proceeds with the application, require the
applicant to furnish him with the consent in
writing of such living person or, as the case may
be, of the legal representative of the deceased
person to the connection appearing on the trade
mark, and may refuse to proceed with the
application unless the applicant furnishes the
Registrar with such consent.
Withdrawal of Acceptance
Section 19 provides that where, after the
acceptance of an application for registration of a
trade mark but before its registration, the
Registrar is satisfied-
(a) that the application has been accepted in
error; or
(b) that in the circumstances of the case the
trade mark should not be registered or should be
registered subject to conditions or limitations or
to conditions additional to or different from the
conditions or limitations subject to which the
application has been accepted, the Registrar
may, after hearing the applicant if he so desires,
withdraw the acceptance and proceed as if the
application had not been accepted.
Advertisement of Application
According to Section 20, once the Registrar for
registration has accepted the application, he
shall get the application advertised in the
prescribed manner after acceptance. However,
the application shall be advertised before
acceptance if the application is related to a
trademark to which Section 9(1) and Section
11(1) & (2) apply or in any other case as it
seems expedient to the Registrar. The purpose
of advertisement is to give information to the
public at large in respect of the trademark
advertised and afford an opportunity to oppose
the registration of the mark on given grounds. So
the advertisement must be complete in all
respects and otherwise the very purpose of
advertisement will be frustrated. If there is
incomplete or incorrect information in the
advertisement, it would amount to
misrepresentation, which deprives a prospective
opponent of the opportunity to get full information
and of filing an effective opposition.
Registration
Section 23 states that subject to the provisions
of section 19, when an application for
registration of a trade mark has been accepted
and either:-
(a) the application has not been opposed and the
time for notice of opposition has expired; or
(b) the application has been opposed and the
opposition has been decided in favour of the
applicant, the Registrar shall, unless the Central
Government otherwise directs, register the said
trade mark within eighteen months of the filing of
the application and the trade mark when
registered shall be registered as of the date of
the making of the said application and that date
shall, subject to the provisions of section 154, be
deemed to be the date of registration.
On the registration of a trade mark, the Registrar
shall issue to the applicant a certificate in the
prescribed form of the registration thereof,
sealed with the seal of the Trade Marks Registry.
Where registration of a trade mark is not
completed within twelve months from the date of
the application by reason of default on the part
of the applicant, the Registrar may, after giving
notice to the applicant in the prescribed manner,
treat the application as abandoned unless it is
completed within the time specified in that behalf
in the notice.
The Registrar may amend the register or a
certificate of registration for the purpose of
correcting a clerical error or an obvious mistake.
Duration, Renewal, Removal and Restoration of
Registration
Section 25 of the Act deals with duration,
renewal of registration, for removal and
restoration of registration. It allows registration of
a trademark for a period of 10 years. In keeping
with the generally accepted international practice
and to reduce the work-load of the Trade Marks
Office, Section 25 allows renewal of registration
for successive periods of 10 years, from the date
of the original registration or the last renewal.
With a view to facilitate renewal of registration,
Section 25(4) provides for restoration of
removed trade marks on payment of renewal
fee.
Can a Registered Trademark be Removed from
the Register?
It can be removed on application to the Registrar
on prescribed form on the ground that the mark
is wrongly remaining on the register. The
Registrar also can suo moto issue Notice for
removal of a registered trademark.
Infringement of Registered Trade Marks
A person shall be deemed to have infringed a
registered trade mark, if he uses a mark which is
identical with or similar to the registered trade
mark, and is used in relation to goods or services
which are not similar to those for which
trademark is registered; and the registered trade
mark has a reputation in India and the use of the
mark without due cause would take unfair
advantage of or is detrimental to the distinctive
character or repute of the registered trade mark.
Section 29 dealing with infringement of
trademarks, explicitly enumerates the grounds
which constitute infringement of a trademark.
Section 29(1) provides that a registered trade
mark is infringed by a person who, not being a
registered proprietor or a person using by way of
permitted use, uses in the course of trade, a
mark which is identical with, or deceptively
similar to, the trade mark in relation to goods or
services in respect of which the trade mark is
registered and in such manner as to render the
use of the mark likely to be taken as being used
as a trade mark.
As per section 29(2) of the Act, a registered
trade mark is infringed by a person who, not
being a registered proprietor or a person using
by way of permitted use, uses in the course of
trade, a mark which because of-
(a) its identity with the registered trade mark and
the similarity of the goods or services covered by
such registered trade mark; or
(b) its similarity to the registered trade mark and
the identity or similarity of the goods or services
covered by such registered trade mark; or
(c) its identity with the registered trade mark and
the identity of the goods or services covered by
such registered trade mark, is likely to cause
confusion on the part of the public, or is likely to
have an association with the registered trade
mark.
Section 29(3) states that in any case falling
under section 29(2)(c), the court shall presume
that it is likely to cause confusion on the part of
the public.
Section 29(4) provides that a registered trade
mark is infringed by a person who, not being a
registered proprietor or a person using by way of
permitted use, uses in the course of trade, a
mark which-
(a) is identical with or similar to the registered
trade mark; and
(b) is used in relation to goods or services which
are not similar to those for which the trade mark
is registered; and
(c) the registered trade mark has a reputation in
India and the use of the mark without due cause
takes unfair advantage of or is detrimental to, the
distinctive character or repute of the registered
trade mark.
According to Section 29(5) of the Ac, a
registered trade mark is infringed by a person if
he uses such registered trade mark, as his trade
name or part of his trade name, or name of his
business concern or part of the name, of his
business concern dealing in goods or services in
respect of which the trade mark is registered.
Section 29(6) provides that a person uses a
registered mark, if, in particular, he:-
(a) affixes it to goods or the packaging thereof;
(b) offers or exposes goods for sale, puts them
on the market, or stocks them for those
purposes under the registered trade mark, or
offers or supplies services under the registered
trade mark;
(c) imports or exports goods under the mark; or
(d) uses the registered trade mark on business
papers or in advertising.
Section 29(7) states that a registered trade mark
is infringed by a person who applies such
registered trade mark to a material intended to
be used for labeling or packaging goods, as a
business paper, or for advertising goods or
services, provided such person, when he applied
the mark, knew or had reason to believe that the
application of the mark was not duly authorised
by the proprietor or a licensee.
As per Section 29(8) a registered trade mark is
infringed by any advertising of that trade mark if
such advertising:-
(a) takes unfair advantage of and is contrary to
honest practices in industrial or commercial
matters; or
                                                       (c) is against
                                                       the reputation
                                                       of the trade
(b) is detrimental to its distinctive character; or    mark.
Section 29(9) provides that where the distinctive
elements of a registered trade mark consist of or
include words, the trade mark may be infringed
by the spoken use of those words as well as by
their visual representation and reference in this
section to the use of a mark shall be construed
accordingly.
In the case of Renaissance Hotel Holdings Inc.
vs. B. Vijaya Sai and Ors. (Civil Appeal No. 404
OF 2022) (Arising out of SLP(C) No. 21428 of
2019) judgement dated 19.01.2022 appeal was
filed against the observation of High Court that
they did not see any infringement of the
Appellant's trade mark "RENAISSANCE" with
that of "SAI RENAISSANCE" of Respondents-
Defendants. Also, that no evidence of a trans-
border reputation for its mark or of any damage
to reputation was presented. Therefore, this
appeal was presented. Supreme Court held that
that High Court has erred in their opinion and
that respondents/defendants had infringed on
the appellant/ trademark plaintiff's
"RENAISSANCE".
Hon'ble Supreme Court of India inter alia
observed that:
A perusal of subsection (2) of Section 29 of the
said Act would reveal that a registered trade
mark would be infringed by a person, who not
being a registered proprietor or a person using
by way of permitted use, uses in the course of
trade, a mark which because of the three
eventualities mentioned in clauses (a), (b) and
(c), is likely to cause confusion on the part of the
public, or which is likely to have an association
with the registered trade mark. The first
eventuality covered by clause (a) being its
identity with the registered trade mark and the
similarity of the goods or services covered by
such registered trade mark. The second one
covered by clause (b) being its similarity to the
registered trade mark and the identity or
similarity of the goods or services covered by
such registered trade mark. The third eventuality
stipulated in clause (c) would be its identity with
the registered trade mark and the identity of the
goods or services covered by such registered
trade mark.
It is, however, pertinent to note that by virtue of
subsection (3) of Section 29 of the said Act, the
legislative intent insofar as the eventuality
contained in clause (c) is concerned, is clear.
Subsection (3) of Section 29 of the said Act
provides that in any case falling under clause (c)
of subsection (2) of Section 29 of the said Act,
the Court shall presume that it is likely to cause
confusion on the part of the public. Subsection
(4) of Section 29 of the said Act provides that a
registered trade mark is infringed by a person
who, not being a registered proprietor or a
person using by way of permitted use, uses in
the course of trade, a mark which is identical with
or similar to the registered trade mark; and is
used in relation to goods or services which are
not similar to those for which the trade mark is
registered; and the registered trade mark has a
reputation in India and the use of the mark
without due cause takes unfair advantage of or is
detrimental to, the distinctive character or repute
of the registered trade mark.
Subsection (5) of Section 29 of the said Act
provides that a registered trade mark is infringed
by a person if he uses such registered trade
mark, as his trade name or part of his trade
name, or name of his business concern or part of
the name, of his business concern dealing in
goods or services in respect of which the trade
mark is registered.
Subsection (6) of Section 29 of the said Act
provides that for the purposes of this section, a
person uses a registered mark, if, in particular,
he affixes it to goods or the packaging thereof;
offers or exposes goods for sale, puts them on
the market, or stocks them for those purposes
under the registered trade mark, or offers or
supplies services under the registered trade
mark; imports or exports goods under the mark;
or uses the registered trade mark on business
papers or in advertising.
Subsection (7) of Section 29 of the said Act
provides that a registered trade mark is infringed
by a person who applies such registered trade
mark to a material intended to be used for
labelling or packaging goods, as a business
paper, or for advertising goods or services,
provided such person, when he applied the
mark, knew or had reason to believe that the
application of the mark was not duly authorized
by the proprietor or a licensee.
Subsection (8) of Section 29 of the said Act
provides that a registered trade mark is infringed
by any advertising of that trade mark if such
advertising takes unfair advantage of and is
contrary to honest practices in industrial or
commercial matters; or is detrimental to its
distinctive character; or is against the reputation
of the trade mark.
Subsection (9) of Section 29 of the said Act
provides that where the distinctive elements of a
registered trade mark consist of or include
words, the trade mark may be infringed by the
spoken use of those words as well as by their
visual representation and reference in this
section to the use of a mark shall be construed
accordingly.
The legislative scheme is clear that when the
mark of the defendant is identical with the
registered trade mark of the plaintiff and the
goods or services covered are similar to the
ones covered by such registered trade mark, it
may be necessary to prove that it is likely to
cause confusion on the part of the public, or
which is likely to have an association with the
registered trade mark. Similarly, when the trade
mark of the plaintiff is similar to the registered
trade mark of the defendant and the goods or
services covered by such registered trade mark
are identical or similar to the goods or services
covered by such registered trade mark, it may
again be necessary to establish that it is likely to
cause confusion on the part of the public.
However, when the trade mark of the defendant
is identical with the registered trade mark of the
plaintiff and that the goods or services of the
defendant are identical with the goods or
services covered by registered trade mark, the
Court shall presume that it is likely to cause
confusion on the part of the public.
It is thus trite law that while interpreting the
provisions of a statute, it is necessary that the
textual interpretation should be matched with the
contextual one. The Act must be looked at as a
whole and it must be discovered what each
section, each clause, each phrase and each
word is meant and designed to say as to fit into
the scheme of the entire Act. No part of a statute
and no word of a statute can be construed in
isolation. Statutes have to be construed so that
every word has a place and everything is in its
place. As already discussed hereinabove, the
said Act has been enacted by the legislature
taking into consideration the increased
globalization of trade and industry, the need to
encourage investment flows and transfer of
technology, and the need for simplification and
harmonization of trade mark management
systems. One of the purposes for which the said
Act has been enacted is prohibiting the use of
someone else's trade mark as a part of the
corporate name or the name of business
concern. If the entire scheme of the Act is
construed as a whole, it provides for the rights
conferred by registration and the right to sue for
infringement of the registered trade mark by its
proprietor. The legislative scheme as enacted
under the said statute elaborately provides for
the eventualities in which a proprietor of the
registered trade mark can bring an action for
infringement of the trade mark and the limits on
effect of the registered trade mark. By picking up
a part of the provisions in subsection (4) of
Section 29 of the said Act and a part of the
provision in subsection (1) of Section 30 of the
said Act and giving it a textual meaning without
considering the context in which the said
provisions have to be construed, in our view,
would not be permissible. We are at pains to say
that the High Court fell in error in doing so.
We are, therefore, of the considered view that
the High Court fell in error on various counts.
The present case stood squarely covered by the
provisions of Section 29(2)(c) read with
subsection (3) of Section 29 of the said Act. The
present case also stood covered under
subsections (5) and (9) of Section 29 of the said
Act. The High Court has erred in taking into
consideration clause (c) of subsection (4) of
Section 29 of the said Act in isolation without
noticing other parts of the said subsection (4) of
Section 29 of the said Act and the import
thereof. The High Court has failed to take into
consideration that in order to avail the benefit of
Section 30 of the said Act, apart from
establishing that the use of the impugned trade
mark was not such as to take unfair advantage
of or is detrimental to the distinctive character or
repute of the trade mark, it is also necessary to
establish that such a use is in accordance with
the honest practices in industrial or commercial
matters. As such, we have no hesitation to hold
that the High Court was not justified in interfering
with the well-reasoned order of the trial court.
In the case of Imperial Tobacco Co. of India Ltd.
vs. The Registrar of Trade Marks Calcutta High
Court judgement dated 28 May, 1968 , the
Imperial Tobacco Company manufactured and
distributed cigarettes with a label "simla" all over
the country. ITC ltd. made an application to the
Registrar for the registration in the year 1960
and 1966. But both the times the registration
application was refused by the registrar. The
Calcutta High Court rejected the appeal on the
ground that the term "simla" is a famous
geographical place. This term cannot be
registered as a trademark. The trade mark
"Simla" with the label is composite in character.
Its essential feature is the word Simla. ''Simla" is
neither an invented word nor is it a word having
a dictionary meaning. It is a well-known hill-
station of India. Its geographical signification is,
therefore, plain and unequivocal. The snow-clad
hills in outline on the label makes the
geographical significance inescapable.
A suit was brought against Amul Canada by the
Kaira District Cooperative Milk Producers Union
Limited (Amul Dairy) and the Gujarat
Cooperative Milk Marketing Federation
(GCMMF), AMUL's official brand's distributors.
The dairy behemoth discovered that the
organisation had imitated the trademark "Amul"
and the slogan "Amul - The Taste of India" in
January 2020. The four people were listed as
Amul Canada workers. Amul testified before the
court that he never granted Amul Canada or any
of the four people permission to utilise their
trademarks and copyrights.
Canadian Court opined that the defendants had
violated and infringed the copyright and
trademark. The court awarded CAD 32,733
(around Rs 19.5 lakh) in damages and issued an
order prohibiting the defendants from using
"Amul" and "Amul-The Taste of India" copyright
and trademark.
Limits on Effect of Registered Trade Mark
Section 30 enumerates certain acts which do not
constitute infringement. This section explicitly
states that nothing in section 29 shall be
construed as preventing the use of a registered
trade mark by any person for the purposes of
identifying goods or services as those of the
proprietor provided the use- (a) is in accordance
with honest practices in industrial or commercial
matters, and
(b) is not such as to take unfair advantage of or
be detrimental to the distinctive character or
repute of the trade mark.
Section 30(2) states that a registered trade mark
is not infringed where-
(a) the use in relation to goods or services
indicates the kind, quality, quantity, intended
purpose, value, geographical origin, the time of
production of goods or of rendering of services
or other characteristics of goods or services;
(b) a trade mark is registered subject to any
conditions or limitations, the use of the trade
mark in any manner in relation to goods to be
sold or otherwise traded in, in any place, or in
relation to goods to be exported to any market or
in relation to services for use or available for
acceptance in any place or country outside India
or in any other circumstances, to which, having
regard to those conditions or limitations, the
registration does not extend;
(c) the use by a person of a trade mark-
(i) in relation to goods connected in the course of
trade with the proprietor or a registered user of
the trade mark if, as to those goods or a bulk of
which they form part, the registered proprietor or
the registered user conforming to the permitted
use has applied the trade mark and has not
subsequently removed or obliterated it, or has at
any time expressly or impliedly consented to the
use of the trade mark; or
(ii) in relation to services to which the proprietor
of such mark or of a registered user conforming
to the permitted use has applied the mark, where
the purpose and effect of the use of the mark is
to indicate, in accordance with the fact, that
those services have been performed by the
proprietor or a registered user of the mark;
(d) the use of a trade mark by a person in
relation to goods adapted to form part of, or to
be accessory to, other goods or services in
relation to which the trade mark has been used
without infringement of the right given by
registration under this Act or might for the time
being be so used, if the use of the trade mark is
reasonably necessary in order to indicate that
the goods or services are so adapted, and
neither the purpose nor the effect of the use of
the trade mark is to indicate, otherwise than in
accordance with the fact, a connection in the
course of trade between any person and the
goods or services, as the case may be;
(e) the use of a registered trade mark, being one
of two or more trademarks registered under this
Act which are identical or nearly resemble each
other, in exercise of the right to the use of that
trade mark given by registration under this Act.
The Madras High Court in Consim Info Pvt. Ltd
vs. Google India Pvt. Ltd. 2013 (54) PTC 578
(Mad), relied upon two U.S. Ninth Circuit
judgments, to interpret the meaning of the words
'reasonably necessary' used in section 30(2)(d)
and held that for any unauthorized use of the
trademark to be considered a 'nominative fair
use', it must meet three tests viz., (i) the product
or service in question must be one not readily
identifiable without use of the trademark; (ii) only
so much of the mark or marks may be used as is
reasonably necessary to identify the product or
service; and (iii) the user must do nothing that
would, in conjunction with the mark, suggest
sponsorship or endorsement by the proprietor of
the trademark.
As per Section 30(3) of the Act, where the goods
bearing a registered trade mark are lawfully
acquired by a person, the sale of the goods in
the market or otherwise dealing in those goods
by that person or by a person claiming under or
through him is not infringement of a trade mark
by reason only of-
(a) the registered trade mark having been
assigned by the registered proprietor to some
other person, after the acquisition of those
goods; or
(b) the goods having been put on the market
under the registered trade mark by the proprietor
or with his consent.
Section 30 (3) shall not apply where there exists
legitimate reasons for the proprietor to oppose
further dealings in the goods in particular, where
the condition of the goods, has been changed or
impaired after they have been put on the market.
In the case, Samsung Electronics Company
Limited and Ors. vs. Kapil Wadhwa and Ors.
(17.02.2012 - Delhi High Court): MIPR 2012 (2)
1: 2012 (49) PTC 571 (Del): 2012(4) R.A.J. 13,
the plaintiffs have raised the complaint before
this court by preferring a suit for infringement of
the trade mark and passing off the mark
SAMSUNG. Court held that "Section 30(3) of the
Trade Marks Act, 1999 acts as an exception to
the infringement of registered trade marks as the
head note of Section 30 itself speaks for itself
which says limits on the effects of registered
trademark and the wordings of Section 30(3) in
particular also states that the selling of goods in
the market or otherwise dealing in those goods is
not an infringement of trademark. The said
exception operates in the nature of defence to
an infringement wherein the person using the
mark in a particular form or dealing otherwise in
the goods under the mark can plead that the said
goods are lawfully acquired from the market
wherein the proprietor has also put the goods in
the market or the proprietor has given consent to
the effect of such dealings or usage. The
provision relating to exhaustion or proprietor's
consent is a complete defense to an
infringement act. Therefore, the nature and the
scope of Section 30(3) is that it operates as a
defence to the infringing act and cannot be said
to giving any additional right beyond the same."
PASSINg OFF
Black's Law Dictionary defines passing off as
"the act or an instance falsely representing one's
own product as that of another in an attempt to
deceive potential buyers. Passing off is
actionable in tort under the law of unfair
competition. It may be actionable as trademark
infringement".
With the tremendous growth in trade and
commerce, the competitors or other traders tend
to imitate the wellknown or reputed trademarks
by imitating colour scheme or get up or
packaging with a view to pass off such goods as
goods of the genuine owner. In cases of
registered trademarks, the owner can move the
court under this Act for the infringement whereas
in cases of the unregistered trademarks, the Act
recognizes the Common Law remedy of passing
off. The tort of passing off is based upon the
principle that "no man is entitled to represent his
goods as being the goods of another man; and
no man is required to use any mark, sign or
symbol, device or means, whereby without
making a direct representation himself to a
purchaser who purchases from him, he enables
such purchaser to tell a lie or to make a false
representation to somebody else who is the
ultimate purchaser."

The plaintiff, in an action of passing off, has to
establish that his business or goods has
acquired the reputation and that his mark has
become distinctive of his goods among the
public at large. He has to establish that there is
likely hood of deception or confusion in the
minds of the public. He, however, does not have
to establish the fraudulent intention on the part of
the defendant. Thirdly, he has to establish that
confusion is likely to cause damage or injury to
the reputation, goodwill and fair name of the
plaintiff. He need not prove the actual loss or
damage in an action of passing off.

the same weightage cannot be given to each

Registration to be Prima Facie Evidence of
validity
Section 31 of the Act stipulates that in all legal
proceedings relating to trade mark registered
under the Act, the original registration and all
subsequent assignments and transmission
thereof shall be prima facie evidence of its
validity. However, as per Section 34 the
proprietor or a registered user of a registered
trademark is not entitled to interfere with or
restrain the use by any person of a trademark
identical with or nearly resembling it in relation to
goods or services in relation to which that person
or a predecessor in title of his has continuously
used that trade mark from a prior date.
Therefore, in case of unregistered marks, the
owner of the trade mark may lodge a case
against passing off action in case his trademark
is used by some other person. It has been held
by the courts in various cases and the ownership
of a trademark is decided by its usage in
commercial transactions.
The Supreme Court in Uniply Industries Ltd. vs.
Unicorn Plywood Pvt. Ltd. and Others observed
that:
(i) for inherently distinctive marks ownership is
governed by priority of use for such marks. The
first user of sale of goods/services is the owner
who is senior to others.
(ii) These marks are given legal protection
against infringement immediately upon adoption
and use in trade.
(iii) Some courts indicate that even prior sales of
goods - though small in size with the mark - are
sufficient to establish priority, the test being to
determine continuous prior user and the volume
of sale or the degree of familiarity of the public
with the mark.
Therefore, the proprietorship of the trademark is
decided by the date of usage of the mark by a
person in business transactions.
Assignment and Transmission
Section 37 entitles the registered proprietor of a
trademark to assign the trade mark and to give
effectual receipts for any consideration for such
assignment. Section 38 deals with the
assignability and transmissibility of a registered
trade mark with or without goodwill of the
business either in respect of all goods or
services or part thereof. Section 39 provides that
unregistered trade mark may be assigned or
transmitted with or without the goodwill of the
business concerned.
Section 40 contains restriction on assignments
or transmissions of trade mark where multiple
exclusive rights would be created in more than
one person in relation to same goods or
services; same description of goods or services;
goods or services or description of goods or
services which are associated with each other,
which would be likely to deceive or cause
confusion. Nevertheless, such assignment is not
deemed to be invalid, if having regard to the
limitations imposed, the goods are to be sold in
different markets - either within India or through
exports.
Section 42 stipulates conditions for assignment
of a trade mark without goodwill of business.
Such an assignment shall not take effect unless
the assignor obtains directions of the Registrar
and advertises the assignment in accordance
with the directions of the Registrar and as per
the prescribed manner.
Section 43 deals with the assignability and
transmissibility of certification trade marks and
provides that the assignment of certification
trade mark can only be done only with the
consent of the Registrar. Section 44 states that
associated trademarks shall be assignable and
transmissible only as a whole but they will be
treated as separate trade marks for all other
purposes. Section 45 deals with the procedure
for registration of assignment and transmission
and provides that where the validity of an
assignment is in dispute between the parties, the
Registrar may refuse to register the assignment
or transmission unless the rights of parties are
determined by the competent court.
Proposed Use of Trade Mark by Company to be
Formed
Section 46 empowers the Registrar to allow
registration of a trademark, if he is satisfied that-
(i) a company is about to be formed and
registered under the Companies Act and that the
applicant intends to assign the trademark to that
company with a view to use thereof in relation to
those goods and services by the company; or
(ii) the proprietor intends it to be used by a
person, as a registered user after the registration
of trademark.
Removal of Trade Mark for Non-use
Section 47 deals with removal of a trade mark
from the register on the ground of non-use and
provides that a trade mark which is not used
within five years of its registration, becomes
liable for removal either completely or in respect
of those goods or services for which the mark
has not been used. The five years period starts
from the date on which the trade mark is actually
entered on the register. However, Section 47(3)
protects a mark from being removed from the
register on ground of non-use if such non-use is
shown to have been due to special
circumstances in the trade which may include
restriction imposed by any law or regulation on
the use of trade mark in India.
Registered User
Section 48 deals with registered users. Section
49 provides for registration as registered user.
Section 50 deals with the power of the Registrar
to vary or cancel registration as registered user
on the ground that the registered user has used
the trade mark otherwise than in accordance
with the agreement or in such a way as to cause
or likely to cause confusion, or deception or the
proprietor/registered user misrepresented or has
failed to disclose any material facts for such
registration or the stipulation in the agreement
regarding the quality of goods is not enforced or
the circumstances have changed since the date
of registration, etc. However, Registrar has been
put under obligation to give reasonable
opportunity of hearing before cancellation of
registration.
In view of the simplification of the procedure for
registration of registered user and to ascertain
whether the registered user agreement is in
force, Section 51 empowers the Registrar to
require the proprietor to confirm at any time
during the continuation of registration as
registered user, whether the agreement, on the
basis of which registered user was registered is
still in force, and if such confirmation is not
received within a period of one month, the
Registrar shall remove the entry thereof from the
Register in the prescribed manner. Section 52
recognises the right of registered user to take
proceedings against infringement. Section 54
provides that the registered user will not have a
right of assignment or transmission. However, it
is clarified that where an individual registered
user enters into partnership or remains in a
reconstituted firm, the use of the mark by the firm
would not amount to assignment or transmission.
Collective Marks
Collective Marks means a trades mark
distinguish the goods or services of members of
an association of person not being a partnership
within the meaning of the Indian Partnership Act,
1932 which is the proprietor of the mark from
those of others.
Sections 61 to 68 contain provisions relating to
the registration of Collective trade marks. These
sections provide for registration of a collective
mark which belongs to a group or association of
persons and the use thereof is reserved for
members of the group or association of persons.
Collective marks serve to distinguish
characteristic features of the products or
services offered by those enterprises. It may be
owned by an association which may not use the
collective mark but whose members may use the
same. The association ensures compliance of
certain quality standards by its members, who
may use the collective mark if they comply with
the prescribed requirements concerning its use.
The primary function of a collective mark is to
indicate a trade connection with the Association
or Organisation.
Certification Trade Marks
Certification trade mark as to mean a mark
capable of distinguishing the goods or services
in connection with which it is used in the course
of trade which are certified by the proprietor of
the mark in respect of origin, material, mode of
manufacture of goods or performance of
services, quality, accuracy or other
characteristics from goods or services not so
certified and registerable as such in respect of
those goods or services in the name, as
proprietor of the certification trade mark, of that
person.
Sections 69 to 78 deal with registration of
certification trade mark. The purpose of
certification trade mark is to show that the goods
on which the mark is used have been certified by
some competent person in respect of certain
characteristics of the goods such as origin,
mode of manufacture, quality, etc. The proprietor
of a certification trade mark does not himself deal
in the goods. A certification trade mark may be
used in addition to the users own trade mark on
his goods. Central Government empower the
final authority for registration of certification trade
mark to the Registrar.
Appointment of Registrar and Trade Mark
Registry
Section 3 provides for appointment of the
Registrar and other officers and Section 4
empowers the Registrar to withdraw any matter
pending before an officer and deal with such
matter himself or transfer it to another officer
with reasons for such transfer to be recorded
therein. Section 5 deals with the establishment
of the Trade Marks Registry and branch offices
and provides that the Trade Marks Registry
established under the Trade and Merchandise
Marks Act, 1958 shall continue to be the Trade
Marks Registry for the purposes of this Act.
Register of Trade Marks
Section 6 contains provisions relating to
maintenance of a single Register of Trade Marks
at Head Office including therein particulars of
registered trademarks and other prescribed
particulars, except notice of trust. A copy of the
Register is to be kept at each branch office. Sub-
section (2) allows the maintenance of records in
computer floppies or diskettes or in any other
electronic form subject to the prescribed
safeguards.
What does the Register of Trademark Contain?
The register of trademark currently maintained in
electronic form contains inter alia the trademark
the class and goods/ services in respect of which
it is registered including particulars affecting the
scope of registration of rights conferred; the
address of the proprietors; particulars of trade or
other description of the proprietor; the
convention application date (if applicable); where
a trademark has been registered with the
consent of proprietor of an earlier mark or earlier
rights, that fact.
Classification of goods and Services and
Publication of Index
Section 7 empowers the Registrar to classify
goods and services according to international
classification of goods and services and to
determine any question related thereto. Section
8 requires the Registrar to publish an
alphabetical index of classification of goods and
services.
According to Rule 20 of the Trade Marks Rules,
2017, classification of goods and service for the
purpose of registration of trademark, the goods
and services shall be classified as per current
edition of "the International Classification of
goods and services (NICE classification)"
published by the World Intellectual Property
Organization (WIPO). The Registrar shall publish
a class wise and an alphabetical index of such
goods and services, including goods and
services of Indian origin.
Trade Mark Agent
Section 145 deals with agents and provide that
Where, by or under the Trade Marks Act, any
act, other than the making of an affidavit, is
required to be done before the Registrar by any
person, the act may, subject to the rules made in
this behalf, be done instead of by that person
himself, by a person duly authorised in the
prescribed manner, who is- (a) a legal
practitioner, or
                                                      (b) a person

                                                      the
                                                      prescribed      (c) a person in the
                                                      manner as a     sole and regular
                                                      trade marks     employment of the
                                                      agent, or       principal.

LESSON ROUND-UP
* Trade Mark distinguishes the goods of one
manufacturer or trader from similar goods of
others and therefore, it seeks to protect the
interest of the consumer as well as the trader. A
trade mark may consist of a device depicting the
picture of animals, human beings etc., words,
letters, numerals, signatures or any combination
thereof.
* The Trade Marks Act, 1999 and the Trade
Marks Rules, 2017 govern the law relating to
Trade Marks in India.
* Object of trademark law is to permit an
enterprise by registering its trademark to obtain
an exclusive right to use, share, or assign a

REgULATORY FRAMEWORK
                                                     The CopyrightThe Copyright
?                                                    Act, 1957 ? Rules, 2013
The Copyright Act, 1957 protects original literary,
dramatic, musical and artistic works and
cinematograph films and sound recordings from
unauthorized uses. Under Article 9.2 of the
TRIPS Agreements, copyright protects the
expressions and not the ideas. There is no
copyright protection for ideas, procedures, and
methods of operation or mathematical concepts
as such.
INTRODUCTION
Copyright is a well recognised form of property
right which had its roots in the common law
system and subsequently came to be governed
by the national laws in each country. Copyright
as the name suggests arose as an exclusive
right of the author to copy the literature produced
by him and stop others from doing so. There are
well-known instances of legal intervention to
punish a person for copying literary or aesthetic
output of another even before the concept of
copyright took shape. The concept of idea was
originally concerned with the field of literature
and arts. In view of technological advancements
in recent times, copyright protection has been
expanded considerably. Today, copyright law
has extended protection not only to literary,
dramatic, musical and artistic works but also
sound recordings, films, broadcasts, cable
programmes and typographical arrangements of
publications. Computer programs have also
been brought within the purview of copyright law.
Copyright deals with the rights of intellectual
creators in their creation. The copyright law
deals with the particular forms of creativity,
concerned primarily with mass communication. It
is also concerned with virtually all forms and
methods of public communication, not only
printed publications but also with such matters
as sound, and television broadcasting, films for
public exhibition etc. and even computerised
systems for the storage and retrieval of
information.
In India, the law relating to copyright is governed
by the Copyright Act, 1957 which has been
amended in 1983, 1984, 1985, 1991, 1992,
1994, 1999 and 2012 and 2021. The copyright
law aims to endorse exclusive forms of artistic
works at the same time safeguarding the rights
of its inventor. The scope of the law extends as
far as literary, music, software, graphics,
choreography, movies and likewise is
concerned. These categories are further sub-
categorised into books, documentaries, painting,
articles and likewise, which aim in promoting
work and not ideas. It is to be noted that the
work of the creator is protected by the copyright
law irrespective of its content or quality. Although
the registration of the work is not a mandate,
nevertheless it is always advisable to register the
work the moment it is put to force.
What is Copyright?
Copyright (or author's right) is a legal term used
to describe the rights that creators have over
their literary and artistic works. Works covered by
copyright range from books, music, paintings,
sculpture, and films, to computer programs,
databases, advertisements, maps, and technical
drawings.
The object of copyright is to protect and reward
the general advantages i.e. the authors' labour
on the created work. This helps the writers to
constantly produce and carry out more plays. It is
important to note that in a given work, copyright
law protects the "type of material
communication," not the individual concepts,
ideas, techniques or details. That is the reason
why work has to be set in a physical form to be
covered by copyright. A few examples of works
being tangibly set to include stories written on
paper and initial canvas paintings. The forms of
work protected by copyright laws include, among
other items, song lyrics, books, playbacks,
images, computer programs, and emails.
Though, you can't copyright stuff like ideas, titles,
names, details etc. Publishing is important for
businesses because it only gives the author of
the work exclusive rights to replicate their works,
create derivative works, distribute and sell any
copies of the work, show and publicly perform
copyrighted works. You may grant certain rights
as a package or separately. This also helps
owners to produce income if any other individual
opts for reproducing the job.
Why should Copyright be Protected?
Copyright ensures certain minimum safeguards
of the rights of authors over their creations,
thereby protecting and rewarding creativity.
Creativity being the keystone of progress, no
civilized society can afford to ignore the basic
requirement of encouraging the same. Economic
and social development of a society is
dependent on creativity. The protection provided
by copyright to the efforts of writers, artists,
designers, dramatists, musicians, architects and
producers of sound recordings, cinematograph
films and computer software, creates an
atmosphere conducive to creativity, which
induces them to create more and motivates
others to create.
The Copyright Act provides an economic right to
the author to reproduce the work, to issue
copies, to perform or communicate it to the
public, to make any cinematograph film or sound
recording or to make any adaptation or
translation of the work. The Act also provides a
right to claim authorship of the work; an integrity
right- right to protect one's honor and reputation
and a general right- right to not have a work
falsely attributed to oneself. These moral rights
remain with the author even after assignment of
the copyright.
It may be noted that:
Adaptation means,-
(i) in relation to a dramatic work, the conversion
of the work into a non-dramatic work;
(ii) in relation to a literary work or an artistic work,
the conversion of the work into a dramatic work
by way of performance in public or otherwise;
(iii) in relation to a literary or dramatic work, any
abridgement of the work or any version of the
work in which the story or action is conveyed
wholly or mainly by means of pictures in a form
suitable for reproduction in a book, or in a
newspaper, magazine or similar periodical;
(iv) in relation to a musical work, any
arrangement or transcription of the work; and
(v) in relation to any work, any use of such work
involving its re-arrangement or alteration.
Communication to the public means making any
work or performance available for being seen or
heard or otherwise enjoyed by the public directly
or by any means of display or diffusion other
than by issuing physical copies of it, whether
simultaneously or at places and times chosen
individually, regardless of whether any member
of the public actually sees, hears or otherwise
enjoys the work or performance so made
available. However, communication through
satellite or cable or any other means of
simultaneous communication to more than one
household or place of residence including
residential rooms of any hotel or hostel shall be
deemed to be communication to the public.
Sound recording means a recording of sounds
from which such sounds may be produced
regardless of the medium on which such
recording is made or the method by which the
sounds are produced.
Author means,-
(i) in relation to a literary or dramatic work, the
author of the work;
(ii) in relation to a musical work, the composer;
(iii) in relation to an artistic work other than a
photograph, the artist;
(iv) in relation to a photograph, the person taking
the photograph;
(v) in relation to a cinematograph or sound
recording the producer; and
(vi) in relation to any literary, dramatic, musical
or artistic work which is computer-generated, the
person who causes the work to be created;

                                                     dramatic,
                                                     musical or

following works, namely: ?                           ?              film; ?         recording.
MEANINg OF COPYRIgHT
Copyright is an intellectual property right that law
gives to a creator of literary, dramatic, musical,
and artistic work and a producer of
cinematograph films and sound recordings. It
also applies to architectural works and computer
program/software. It can be understood as a
bundle of rights that include the right of
reproduction, communication, adaptation, and
translation of the work. Copyright ensures
protection to the rights of authors over their
creations and in turn aims at rewarding
creativity.
Section 14 of the Act defines the term Copyright
as to mean the exclusive right to do or authorise
the doing of the following acts in respect of a
work or any substantial part thereof, namely:

including the storing of it in any medium by
electronic means; to issue copies of the work to
the public not being copies already in circulation;


(iii)
to perform the work in public, or communicate it
to the public;


(iv)
to make any cinematograph film or sound
recording in respect of the work;


(v)
to make any translation of the work;


(vi)

not include the rental, lease or lending of a
lawfully acquired copy of a computer
programme, sound recording, visual recording or
cinematograph film for non-profit purposes by a
non-profit library or non-profit educational
institution.

In the case of Gramophone Company of India
Ltd. vs. Super Cassette Industries Ltd. R.A.J.
433: 2010 (44) PTC 541 (Del) - Infringement of
original literary, dramatic and musical works.
Whether action of the Defendant in using its
sound recording to produce a cinematograph film
constitutes infringement of the Plaintiffs
copyright in the original literary, dramatic and
musical works. Copyright conferred on the owner
of a copyright in a sound recording by virtue of
Section 14(e) does not specifically include the
right to make a cinematograph film embodying
the sound recording. It gives the owner exclusive
right to make any other sound recording
embodying it. Right to utilise the literary,
dramatic or musical work to make a
cinematograph film is specifically conferred on
the owner of the copyright in the literary,
dramatic or musical work by virtue of Section
14(a)(iv) of the Act. Without the specific
permission of the owners of the copyright in the
musical, dramatic, or literary works from which
the sound recording was made, the owner of the
copyright in a sound recording cannot proceed
with incorporating the sound recording or version
recording in a cinematograph film.

ASSIgNMENT OF COPYRIgHT
Section 18 of the Copyright Act provides that the
owner of the copyright in an existing work or the
prospective owner of the copyright in a future
work may assign to any person the copyright
either wholly or partially and either generally or
subject to limitations and either for the whole
term of the copyright or any part thereof.
However, in case of the assignment of copyright
in any future work, the assignment shall take
effect only when the work comes into existence.
No such assignment shall be applied to any
medium or mode of exploitation of the work
which did not exist or was not in commercial use
at the time when the assignment was made,
unless the assignment specifically referred to
such medium or mode of exploitation of the
work.
However, the author of the literary or musical
work included in a cinematograph film shall not
assign or waive the right to receive royalties to
be shared on an equal basis with the assignee
of copyright for the utilization of such work in any
form other than for the communication to the
public of the work along with the cinematograph
film in a cinema hall, except to the legal heirs of
the authors or to a copy right society for
collection and distribution and any agreement to
contrary shall be void.
The author of the literary or musical work
included in the sound recording but not forming
part of any cinematograph film shall not assign or
waive the right to receive royalties to be shared
on an equal basis with the assignee of copyright
for any utilization of such work except to the
legal heirs of the authors or to a collecting
society for collection and distribution and any
assignment to the contrary shall be void. It may
be noted that assignee in respects the
assignment of the copyright in any future work
includes the legal representatives of the
assignee, if the assignee dies before the work
comes into existence.
In Video Master vs. Nishi Production 1998(3)
Bom. CR 782, judgement dated 21 October,
1997, Hon'ble Bombay High Court considered
the issue whether assignment of video rights
would include the right of satellite broadcast as
well. The Court agreed with the defendant's
arguments that there were several public
communication channels, including video TV,
satellite broadcasting, and terrestrial television
broadcasting. The film's owner owned
independent copyright in each of those formats,
and he could assign it to various people. As a
result, the video copyright granted to the plaintiff
would exclude the satellite broadcast copyright
of the film, which was a separate entitlement of
the owner of the film.
Mode of Assignment
Section 19 of the Act provides that an
assignment of the copyright in any work should
be in writing signed by the assignor or by his
duly authorised agent. The assignment of
copyright in any work required to identify such
work, and also specify the rights assigned; the
duration; territorial extent of such assignment;
the amount of royalty and any other
consideration payable to the author or his legal
heirs during the currency of the assignment and
the assignment subject to revision, extension or
termination on terms mutually agreed upon by
the parties.
Where the assignee does not exercise the rights
assigned to him under any of the other sub-
sections of this section within a period of one
year from the date of assignment, the
assignment in respect of such rights shall be
deemed to have lapsed after the expiry of the
said period unless otherwise specified in the
assignment.
The assignment of copyright in any work
contrary to the terms and conditions of the rights
already assigned to a copyright society in which
the author of the work is a member is void. The
Assignment of copyright in any work to make a
cinematograph film does not affect the right of
the author of the work to claim an equal share of
royalties and consideration payable in case of
utilization of the work in any form other than for
the communication to the public of the work,
along with the cinematograph film in a cinema
hall.
In the case of K.A. Venugopala Setty vs. Dr.
Suryakanta V. Kamath 1992 (12) PTC 55 (DB)
(Kar) Assignment setup by the defendant is an
oral assignment. Under the provisions contained
in section 19 of the Act, assignment of copyright
must be in writing and signed by the author or his
duly authorized agent stating in clear terms
about the right proposed to be assigned as well
as the size of the work. Hence, an oral
assignment is invalid and it is impermissible in
law.
The Hon'ble Court ruled that Section 19A of the
Act, which deals with copyright disputes, will only
be applicable when a copyright assignment is
made in compliance with Section 19 of the Act,
which means it is in written and signed by the
assignor or his properly authorised agent.
Therefore, provision 19A cannot be considered
to apply in the current instance and preclude the
lawsuit because there isn't an assignment in
writing as required by section 19 of the Act.
Disputes with respect to Assignment of
Copyright
Section 19A(1) provides that if an assignee fails
to make sufficient exercise of the rights assigned
to him, and such failure is not attributable to any
act or omission of the assignor, then, the
Commercial Court may, on receipt of a complaint
from the assignor and after holding such inquiry
as it may deem necessary, revoke such
assignment.
According to Section 19A(2) If any dispute arises
with respect to the assignment of any copyright,
the Commercial Court may, on receipt of a
complaint from the aggrieved party and after
holding such inquiry as it considers necessary,
pass such order as it may deem fit including an
order for the recovery of any royalty payable:
It may be noted that Commercial Court for the
purposes of any State, means a Commercial
Court constituted under section 3, or the
Commercial Division of a High Court constituted
section 4, of the Commercial Courts Act, 2015.
Provided that the Commercial Court shall not
pass any order under this sub-section to revoke
the assignment unless it is satisfied that the
terms of assignment are harsh to the assignor in
case the assignor is also the author:
Provided further that, pending the disposal of an
application for revocation of assignment under
this subsection, the Commercial Court may pass
such order, as it deems fit regarding
implementation of the terms and conditions of
assignment including any consideration to be
paid for the enjoyment of the rights assigned:-
Provided also that, no order of revocation of
assignment under this sub-section, shall be
made within a period of five years from the date
of such assignment.
Every complaint received under Section 19A(2)
shall be dealt with by the Commercial Court as
far as possible and efforts shall be made to pass
the final order in the matter within a period of six
months from the date of receipt of the complaint
and any delay in compliance of the same, the
Commercial Court shall record the reasons
thereof.

REgISTRATION OF COPYRIgHT
Chapter X of the Copyright Act containing
Sections 44- 50A deals with various aspects of
registration of copyright.
The mechanism of registration of copyright has
been contemplated under Section 44 of the Act.
It is evident from the provisions of the aforesaid
section that registration of the work under the
Copyright Act is not compulsory and is not a
condition precedent for maintaining a suit for
damages, if somebody infringes the copyright.
Sections 44 and 45 of the Copyright Act are only
enabling provisions and do not affect the
common law right to sue for infringement of
copyright. An action for infringement can be
brought even if the registration has not been
done. The only effect of registration is that it is
the prima facie evidence of the particulars
entered in the register.
Section 45 of the Act clearly mentions that the
author or publisher of, or the owner of or other
person interested in the Copyright in, any Work
may make an application in the prescribed form
accompanied by the prescribed fee to the
registrar of Copyrights. The use of word "may"
clearly indicate that the author is at the
discretionary liberty to apply for registration of
Copyrights.
An artistic work which is used or is capable of
being used in relation to any goods or services,
the application shall include a statement to that
effect and shall be accompanied by a certificate
from the Registrar of Trade Marks referred to in
section 3 of the Trade Marks Act, 1999 to the
effect that no trade mark identical with or
deceptively similar to such artistic work has been
registered under that Act in the name of, or that
no application has been made under that Act for
such registration by, any person other than the
applicant.
On receipt of an application in respect of any
work, the Registrar of Copyrights may, after
holding such inquiry as he may deem fit, enter
the particulars of the work in the Register of
Copyrights.
Registrar of Copyrights Possess Certain Powers
of Civil Courts
The Register of Copyrights is to be maintained
by the Copyright Office to enter the names or
titles of works and the names and addresses of
authors, publishers and owners of copyright.
The Registrar of Copyrights shall have the
powers of a civil court when trying a suit under
the Code of Civil Procedure, 1908, in respect of
the following matters, namely, -
(a) summoning and enforcing the attendance of
any person and examining him on oath;
(b) requiring the discovery and production of any
document;
(c) receiving evidence on affidavits;
                                                        (e)
                                                        requisitioning
                                                        any public
                                                        record or
                                                        copy thereof (f) any other
(d) issuing commissions for the examination of          from any        matter which may
witnesses or documents;                                 court or office;be prescribed.
In Sanjay Soya Private Ltd. vs. Narayani Trading
Company IA (L) 5011/2020 in COMP (L) 2/2020
the Bombay High Court ruled that no section of
the Act requires registration of copyright before
requesting relief under the Act. Instead, it is up
to the owner's choice whether to register
copyright under the Act. The Convention and the
TRIPS Agreement were also cited by the court to
buttress its ruling. Registration just establishes a
presumption of validity for information placed in
the Copyright register. The word "may" is used in
Section 45(1) of the Act, which deals with entries
in the register of copyrights, and Section 51
states that infringement is not limited to the
registered Work. Protection should be
"automatic" as soon as the Work is created.
The Procedure for Registration
The Copyright Office has been set up to provide
registration facilities to all types of works and is
headed by a Registrar of Copyrights. The
applications are also accepted by post. On-line
registration through "E-filing facility "has also
been provided which facilitates the applicants to
file applications at the time and place chosen by
them.
Chapter XIII of the Copyright Rules, 2013, as
amended, sets out the procedure for the
registration of a work.
The procedure for registration is as follows:
> Application for registration is to be made on
specified Form (Including Statement of
Particulars and Statement of Further Particulars);
> Separate applications should be made for
registration of each work;
> Each application should be accompanied by
the requisite fee prescribed in the second
schedule to the Rules;
> The applications should be signed by the
applicant. The Power of Attorney signed by the
party and accepted by the advocate should also
be enclosed, if applicable;
> The fee is to be paid either in the form of
Demand Draft or Indian Postal Order or through
E payment Each and every column of the
Statement of Particulars and Statement of
Further Particulars should be replied specifically.
Copyright Registration Workflow

//copyright.gov.in/frmWorkFlow.aspx
INFRINgEMENT OF COPYRIgHT
Copyright infringement refers to the
unauthorized use of someone's copyrighted
work. Thus, it is the use of someone's
copyrighted work without permission thereby
infringing certain rights of the copyright holder,
such as the right to reproduce, distribute, display
or perform the protected work. Copyright
protection gives exclusive rights to the owners of
the work to reproduce the work enabling them to
derive financial benefits by exercising such
rights. If any person without authorisation from
the owner exercises these rights in respect of
the work which has copyright protection it
constitutes an infringement of the copyright. If
the reproduction of the work is carried out after
the expiry of the copyright term it will not amount
to an infringement.
Section 51(a) of the Act contemplates situation
in which a copyright shall be deemed to be
infringed. This Section says that a copyright is
infringed when any person without a licence
granted by the owner of the copyright or the
Registrar of Copyright or in contravention of the
conditions of a licence so granted or of any
condition imposed by a competent authority:

(i) does anything, the exclusive right to do which
is by this Act conferred upon the owner of the
copyright, or
(ii) permits for profit any place to be used for the
communication of the work to the public where
such communication constitutes an infringement
of the copyright in the work, unless he was not
aware and had no reasonable ground for
believing that such communication to the public
would be an infringement of copyright; or
Section 51(b) when any person (i) makes for
sale or hire, or sells or lets for hire, or by way of
trade displays or offers for sale or hire, or (ii)
distributes either for the purpose of trade or to
such an extent as to affect prejudicially the
owner of the copyright, or (iii) by way of trade
exhibits in public, or (iv) imports into India, any
infringing copies of the work.
It may be noted that Section 51(b) (iv) i.e.,
imports into India shall apply to the import of one
copy of any work for the private and domestic
use of the importer.
Explanation: For the purposes of section 51, the
reproduction of a literary, dramatic, musical or
artistic work in the form of a cinematograph film
shall be deemed to be an "infringing copy".
It may be noted that "Infringing copy" means,-
(i) in relation to a literary, dramatic, musical or
artistic work, a reproduction thereof otherwise
than in the form of a cinematographic film;
(ii) in relation to a cinematographic film, a copy
of the film made on any medium by any means;
(iii) in relation to a sound recording, any other
recording embodying the same sound recording,
made by any means;
(iv) in relation to a programme or performance in
which such a broadcast reproduction right or a
performer's right subsists under the provisions of
this Act, the sound recording or a
cinematographic film of such programme or
performance, if such reproduction, copy or
sound recording is made or imported in
contravention of the provisions of this Act.
Which are the Common Copyright
Infringements?
The following are some of the commonly known
acts involving infringement of copyright:
? Making infringing copies for sale or hire or
selling or letting them for hire;
? Permitting any place for the performance of
works in public where such performance
constitutes infringement of copyright;
? Distributing infringing copies for the purpose of
trade or to such an extent so as to affect
prejudicially the interest of the owner of
copyright;
? Public exhibition of infringing copies by way of
trade; and > Importation of infringing copies into
India.
In the case of S.K. Dutt vs. Law Book Co. AIR
1954 All 570, the Hon'ble Court held that in
infringement of copyright the onus of proof is on
plaintiff to satisfy the court that the defendant
had infringed his copyright. The plaintiff having
failed to establish any infringement of his
copyright, no question of granting any relief to
the plaintiff could arise. It may here be noted,
however, that there was on behalf of the plaintiff,
no evidence to indicate what damage, if any,
accrued to him, assuming that there was an
infringement of his copyright by the defendants.
Statutory Exceptions-Certain acts not to be
Infringement of Copyright
Certain exceptions to infringement have been
stipulated by the Copyright Act. The object of
these exceptions is to enable the reproduction of
the work for certain public purposes, and for
encouragement of private study, research and
promotion of education. The list of acts which do
not constitute infringement of copyright has been
provided under Section 52 of the Act. These
includes:
                                                   ? private or
                                                   personal use,
(i) A fair dealing with any work, not being a      including
computer programme, for the purposes of-           research;
* criticism or review, whether of that work or of
any other work;
* reporting of current events and current affairs,
including the reporting of a lecture delivered in
public.
It may be noted that storing of any work in any
electronic medium including the incidental
storage of any computer programme which is not
itself an infringing copy for the said purposes,
shall not constitute infringement of copyright.
(ii) The making of copies or adaptation of a
computer programme by the lawful possessor of
a copy of such computer programme, from such
copy in order to utilise the computer programme
for the purposes for which it was supplied; or to
make back-up copies purely as a temporary
protection against loss, destruction or damage in
order only to utilise the computer programme for
the purpose for which it was supplied.
(iii) the doing of any act necessary to obtain
information essential for operating inter-
operability of an independently created computer
programme with other programmes by a lawful
possessor of a computer programme provided
that such information is not otherwise readily
available.
(iv) the observation, study or test of functioning
of the computer programme in order to
determine the ideas and principles which
underline any elements of the programme while
performing such acts necessary for the functions
for which the computer programme was
supplied.
(v) the making of copies or adaptation of the
computer programme from a personally legally
obtained copy for non-commercial personal use.
(vi) the transient or incidental storage of a work
or performance purely in the technical process of
electronic transmission or communication to the
public.
(vii) transient or incidental storage of a work or
performance for the purpose of providing
electronic links, access or integration, where
such links, access or integration has not been
expressly prohibited by the right holder, unless
the person responsible is aware or has
reasonable grounds for believing that such
storage is of an infringing copy.
It may be noted that if the person responsible for
the storage of the copy has received a written
complaint from the owner of copyright in the
work, complaining that such transient or
incidental storage is an infringement, such
person responsible for the storage shall refrain
from facilitating such access
for a period of twenty-one days or till he receives
an order from the competent court refraining
from facilitating access and in case no such
order is received before the expiry of such
period of twenty-one days, he may continue to
provide the facility of such access.
(viii) the reproduction of any work for the purpose
of a judicial proceeding or for the purpose of a
report of a judicial proceeding.

                                                         section 12A of the

Government.
( xxxiii) the importation of copies of any literary or

In the Chancellor, Masters and Scholars of the
University of Oxford and Ors. vs. Rameshwari
Photocopy Services and Ors. (16.09.2016 -
DELHC) : CS(OS) 2439/2012, I.A. Nos.
14632/2012, 430 and 3455/2013, in this case,
the plaintiffs instituted this suit for the relief of
permanent injunction restraining the two
defendants from infringing the copyright of the
plaintiffs in their publications by photocopying,
reproduction and distribution of copies of
plaintiffs' publications on a large scale and
circulating the same and by sale of unauthorised
compilations of substantial extracts from the
plaintiffs' publications by compiling them into
course packs/anthologies for sale.
Court inter alia held that -
Copyright, specially in literary works, is thus not
an inevitable, divine, or natural right that confers
on authors the absolute ownership of their
creations. It is designed rather to stimulate
activity and progress in the arts for the
intellectual enrichment of the public. Copyright is
intended to increase and not to impede the
harvest of knowledge. It is intended to motivate
the creative activity of authors and inventors in
order to benefit the public....
Applying the tests as aforesaid laid down by the
Courts of (i) integral part of continuous flow; (ii)
connected relation; (iii) incidental; (iv) causal
relationship; (v) during (in the course of time, as
time goes by); (vi) while doing; (vii) continuous
progress from one point to the next in time and
space; and, (viii) in the path in which anything
moves, it has to be held that the words in the
course of instruction" within the meaning of
Section 52(1)(i) supra would include
reproduction of any work while the process of
imparting instruction by the teacher and
receiving instruction by the pupil continues i.e.
during the entire academic session for which the
pupil is under the tutelage of the teacher and that
imparting and receiving of instruction is not
limited to personal interface between teacher
and pupil but is a process commencing from the
teacher readying herself/himself for imparting
instruction, setting syllabus, prescribing text
books, readings and ensuring, whether by
interface in classroom/ tutorials or otherwise by
holding tests from time to time or clarifying
doubts of students, that the pupil stands
instructed in what he/she has approached the
teacher to learn. Similarly the words "in the
course of instruction", even if the word
"instruction" have to be given the same meaning
as 'lecture', have to include within their ambit the
prescription of syllabus the preparation of which
both the teacher and the pupil are required to do
before the lecture and the studies which the
pupils are to do post lecture and so that the
teachers can reproduce the work as part of the
question and the pupils can answer the
questions by reproducing the work, in an
examination. Resultantly, reproduction of any
copyrighted work by the teacher for the purpose
of imparting instruction to the pupil as prescribed
in the syllabus during the academic year would
be within the meaning of Section 52(1)(i) of the
Act.
I thus conclude that the action of the defendant
No. 2 University of making a master photocopy
of the relevant portions (prescribed in syllabus)
of the books of the plaintiffs purchased by the
defendant No. 2 University and kept in its library
and making further photocopies out of the said
master copy and distributing the same to the
students does not constitute infringement of
copyright in the said books under the Copyright
Act."
Remedies against Infringement of Copyright
Section 54 defines the term "owner of copyright"
shall include:
(a) an exclusive licensee;
(b) in the case of an anonymous or
pseudonymous literary, dramatic, musical or
artistic work, the publisher of the work, until the
identity of the author or, in the case of an
anonymous work of joint authorship, or a work of
joint authorship published under names all of
which are pseudonyms, the identity of any of the
authors, is disclosed publicly by the author and
the publisher or is otherwise establishment to the
satisfaction of the Commercial Court by that
author or his legal representatives.
Section 55 provides for the civil remedies for
infringement of copyright and entitles the owner
of the copyright to all such remedies by way of
injunction, damages, accounts and otherwise as
may be conferred by law for the infringement of
copyright. Section 58 entitles the owner of the
copyright to initiate proceedings for the
possession of infringing copies and other
materials related thereto. In this context, the
section clarifies that all infringing copies of any
work in which copyright subsists and all plates
used or intended to be used for the production of
such infringing copies shall be deemed to be the
property of the owner of the copyright.
The Copyright law in India provided for remedies
to be made available to the author against a
copyright infringer. The Copyright Act, 1957
provides to an author both Civil, Criminal and
border enforcement remedies. They are:
? Civil Remedies: provide for injunctions,
damages, interpretation of accounts, delivery
and destruction of infringing copies and
damages for conversion.
? Criminal Remedies: provide for imprisonment,
fines, seizures of infringing copies and delivery
of infringing copies to the owner.
? Border Enforcement: also provides for
prohibition of import and destruction of any
imported goods that infringe the copyright of a
person with the assistance of the customs
authorities of India.
Protection of Right of Management Information
As per section 65B any person, who knowingly
removes or alters any rights management
information without authority, or distributes,
imports for distribution, broadcasts or
communicates to the public, without authority,
copies of any work, or performance knowing that
electronic rights management information has
been removed or altered without authority, shall
be punishable with imprisonment which may
extend to two years and shall also be liable to
fine.
                                                          the title or other
                                                          information
                                                          identifying the
It may be noted that "Rights Management                   work or
Information" means,-                                (a)   performance;
(b) the name of the author or performer;
(c) the name and address of the owner of rights;
(d) terms and conditions regarding the use of the
rights; and
(e) any number or code that represents the
information referred to in sub-clauses (a) to (d),
but does not include any device or procedure
intended to identify the user.
OFFENCES & PENALTIES
Chapter XIII of the Act containing Sections 63-70
deal with offences and penalities. Section 63
deals with offences of infringement of copyright
or other rights conferred by the Copyright Act,
1957. This section makes, any person who
knowingly infringes or abates the infringement of
the copyright in a work or any other right
conferred under the Act (except for resale share
right in original copies), liable to imprisonment
for a minimum period of six months which may
extend to three years and with minimum fine of
fifty thousand rupees which may extend upto
rupees two lakhs. However, the court has been
empowered to impose a sentence less than six
months or a fine less than fifty thousand, if the
infringement had not been made for gain in the
course of trade or business. In such situations,
the section requires the courts to mention
adequate and special reasons in the judgement.
Section 63 criminalises the infringement of
copyright and other associated rights conferred
by the Copyright Act except for the right to resale
share in original copies under section 53 A. It
prescribes imprisonment for a term not less than
6 months which may extend up to 3 years and
with a fine, not less than fifty thousand rupees
which may extend to two lakh rupees.
According to section 63, any person who
knowingly infringes or even abets the
infringement of the copyright in a work or any
other rights conferred by the Copyright Act
except the right to resale share in original copies
commits the offence of copyright.
In the case of Jitendra Prasad Singh vs. State of
Assam (2003) 26 PTC 486 GAU, the Hon'ble
Gauhati High Court held that the phrase
"punishable with imprisonment for a term, which
may extend to three years" will mean that the
imprisonment can be for a term as long as three
years, but the expression, "punishable with
imprisonment for less than three years" will
mean that the imprisonment can be for a term
less than three years. Therefore, offences under
Section 63 of the Act are non-bailable in nature,
and as such an application for anticipatory bail
will be maintainable.
M/s Knit Pro International vs. the State of NCT of
Delhi & Anr. (Criminal Appeal No. 807 of 2022)
the Hon'ble Supreme Court of India Judgement
dated May 20, 2022 inter alia observed that thus,
for the offence under Section 63 of the Copyright
Act, the punishment provided is imprisonment
for a term which shall not be less than six months
but which may extend to three years and with
fine. Therefore, the maximum punishment which
can be imposed would be three years.
Therefore, the learned Magistrate may sentence
the accused for a period of three years also. In
that view of the matter considering Part II of the
First Schedule of the Cr.P.C., if the offence is
punishable with imprisonment for three years
and onwards but not more than seven years the
offence is a cognizable offence. Only in a case
where the offence is punishable for
imprisonment for less than three years or with
fine only the offence can be said to be non-
cognizable. In view of the above clear position of
law, the decision in the case of Rakesh Kumar
Paul (supra) relied upon by learned counsel
appearing on behalf of respondent no.2 shall not
be applicable to the facts of the case on hand.
The language of the provision in Part II of First
Schedule is very clear and there is no ambiguity
whatsoever.
Under the circumstances the High Court has
committed a grave error in holding that the
offence under Section 63 of the Copyright Act is
a non-cognizable offence. Thereby the High
Court has committed a grave error in quashing
and setting aside the criminal proceedings and
the FIR. Therefore, the impugned judgment and
order passed by the High Court quashing and
setting aside the criminal proceedings/FIR under
Section 63 of the Copyright Act deserves to be
quashed and set aside.
In view of the above discussion and for the
reason stated above, it is observed and held that
offence under Section 63 of the Copyright Act is
a cognizable and non-bailable offence.
Consequently, the impugned judgment and order
passed by the High Court taking a contrary view
is hereby quashed and set aside and the
criminal proceedings against respondent No.2
for the offence under Sections 63 & 64 of the
Copyright Act now shall be proceeded further in
accordance with law and on its own merits
treating the same as a cognizable and non-
bailable offence.
Power of Police to Seize Infringing Copies
Section 64 of the Act empowers any Police
Officer, not below the rank of a sub-inspector, to
seize without warrant, all copies of the work and
all plates used for the purpose of making
infringing copies of the work, wherever they are
found. However such Police Officer has to
satisfy himself before such seizure, that an
offence under Section 63 in respect of the
infringement of copyright in any work has been,
is being or is likely to be committed. Further,
such Police Officer has been put under obligation
to produce before the Magistrate, as soon as
practicable, all copies and plates so seized. Any
interested person may make an application to
Magistrate, with in fifteen days of such seizure,
for restoring to him such copies and plates.
Section 65 makes liable, any person, who
knowingly makes or has in his possession, any
plate for the purpose of making infringing copies
of any work in which copyright subsists, to
imprisonment which may extend to two years
and also fine.

LESSON ROUND-UP
l Copyright is a well-recognized form of property
right which had its roots in the common law
system and subsequently came to be governed
by the national laws in each country. In India, the
law relating to copyright is governed by the
Copyright Act, 1957.
l Copyright ensures certain minimum safeguards
of the rights of authors over their creations.
l Literary, dramatic, musical or artistic works
enjoy copyright protection for the life time of the
author plus 60 years beyond i.e. 60 years after
his death. In the case of joint authorship which
implies collaboration of two or more authors in
the production of the work, the term of copyright
is to be construed as a reference to the author
who dies last.
l The Act is amended in 2012 with the object of
making certain changes for clarity, to remove
operational difficulties and also to address
certain newer issues that have emerged in the
context of digital technologies and the Internet.
l Section 18 of the Copyright Act provides for the
assignment of copyright in an existing work as
well as future work. In both the cases an
assignment may be made of the copyright either
wholly or partially and generally or subject to
limitations and that too for the whole period of
copyright or part thereof.
l Copyright protection gives exclusive rights to
the owners of the work to reproduce the work
enabling them to derive financial benefits by
exercising such rights. If any person without
authorisation from the owner exercises these
rights in respect of the work which has copyright
protection it constitutes an infringement of the
copyright.
l Certain exceptions to infringement have been
stipulated by the Copyright Act. The object of
these exceptions is to enable the reproduction of
the work for certain public purposes, and for
encouragement of private study, research and
promotion of education.
l The Copyright Act provides for the civil
remedies for infringement of copyright and
entitles the owner of the copyright to all such
remedies by way of injunction, damages, and
accounts.

REgULATORY FRAMEWORK
? Geographical Indications of Goods
(Registration and Protection) Act, 1999
? The Geographical Indications of Goods
(Registration and Protection) Rules, 2002
INTRODUCTION
The desire of mankind for quality and genuine
premium products such as silk, cotton and
spices, having distinct characteristics originating
from a particular region, have over centuries
created an impact on human civilization which
has resulted in discovery of new sea routes and
new continents. These identifications became so
important that these regions started specializing
in producing these unique products, which led to
identifying such goods as originating from a
particular region, which over a period of time has
become renowned globally. Rising demand for
such products among the consumers, gave rise
for counterfeit products, which began to tarnish
the image of genuine products. A effort to
safeguard the interest of the producers and
consumers led to evolution and
conceptualization of "Geographical Indications".
Every region has its claim to fame. Each fame
and reputation was carefully built up and
painstakingly maintained by the masters of that
region, combining the best of nature, man and
traditionally handed over from one generation to
the next for centuries. Gradually, a specific link
between the goods and place of production
evolved resulting in growth of geographical
indications.
Geographical Indications of Goods are that
aspect of industrial property which refers to a
country or to a place situated therein as being
the country or place of origin of that product.
Typically, such a name conveys an assurance of
quality and distinctiveness which is essentially
attributable to the fact of its origin in that defined
geographical locality, region or country.
Geographical Indications covered under Articles
22 to 24 of the WTO Trade Related Aspects of
Intellectual Property Rights (TRIPS) Agreement,
which was part of the Agreements concluding
the Uruguay Round of GATT negotiations.
Geographical Indications as being used currently
includes both the above concepts and it refers to
"... indications which identify a good as
originating in the territory of a country, or a
region or locality in that territory, where a given
quality, reputation or other characteristic of the
good is essentially attributable to its
geographical origin." (Article 22.1 of the TRIPS
Agreement). Consequent upon India joining as a
member state of the TRIPS Agreement a sui-
generis legislation for the protection of
Geographical Indications was enacted in 1999.
The object of the Geographical Indications of
Goods (Registration and Protection) Act, 1999 is
three fold, firstly by specific law governing the
geographical indications of goods in the country
which could adequately protect the interest of
producers of such goods, secondly, to exclude
unauthorized persons from misusing
geographical indications and to protect
consumers from deception and thirdly, to
promote goods bearing Indian geographical
indications in the export market.
Examples of Indian Geographical Indications
are: Darjeeling Tea, Kanchipuram Silk Saree,
Alphanso Mango, Nagpur Orange, Kolhapuri
Chappal, Bikaneri Bhujia, Agra Petha etc.
geographical Indication
Geographical indication in relation to goods
means an indication which identifies such goods
as agricultural goods, natural goods or
manufactured goods as originating, or
manufactured in the territory of a country, or a
region or locality in that territory, where a given
quality, reputation or other characteristic of such
goods is essentially attributable to its
geographical origin and in case where such
goods are manufactured goods one of the
activities of either the production or of
processing or preparation of the goods
concerned takes place in such territory, region or
locality, as the case may be.
It may be noted that any name which is not the
name of a country, region or locality of that
country shall also be considered as the
geographical indication if it relates to a specific
geographical area and is used upon or in relation
to particular goods originating from that country,
region or locality, as the case may be. [Section
2(e)]

It may be noted that:
Goods means any agricultural, natural or
manufactured goods or any goods of handicraft
or of industry and includes food stuff.
Indication includes any name, geographical or
figurative representation or any combination of
them conveying or suggesting the geographical
origin of goods to which it applies.
Example of Registered geographical Indications

Paintings; Raktsey Karpo Apricot of Ladakh etc.
Indication
Indication includes any name, geographical or
figurative representation or any combination of
them conveying or suggesting the geographical
origin of goods to which it applies. [Section 2(g)]
Prohibition of Registration of Certain
geographical Indications
Section 9 of the Act prohibits registration of
certain geographical indications. They are as
follows:-
(a) the use of which would be likely to deceive or
cause confusion; or
(b) the use of which would be contrary to any law
for the time being in force; or
(c) which comprises or contains scandalous or
obscene matter; or
(d) which comprises or contains any matter likely
to hurt the religious susceptibilities of any class
or section of the citizens of India; or
(e) which would otherwise be disentitled to
protection in a court; or
(f) which are determined to be generic names or
indications of goods and are, therefore, not or
ceased to be protected in their country of origin,
or which have fallen into disuse in that country;
or
(g) which, although literally true as to the
territory, region or locality in which the goods
originate, but falsely represent to the persons
that the goods originate in another territory,
region or locality, as the case may be;
shall not be registered as a geographical
indication.
It may be noted that "generic names or
indications'', in relation to goods, means the
name of a goods which, although relates to the
place or the region where the goods was
originally produced or manufactured has lost its
original meaning and has become the common
name of such goods and serves as a designation
for or indication of the kind, nature, type or other
property or characteristic of the goods.
However, in determining whether the name has
become generic, account shall be taken of all
factors including the existing situation in the
region or place in which the name originates and
the area of consumption of the goods.
Registration of geographical Indication
Section 8 of the Act provides that a geographical
indication may be registered in respect of any or
all of the goods, comprised in such class of
goods as may be classified by a region or locality
in that territory, as the case may be the Registrar
and in respect of a definite territory of a country.
The Registrar may also classify the goods under
in accordance with the International
classification of goods for the purposes of
registration of geographical indications and
publish in the prescribed manner in an
alphabetical index of classification of goods.
Any question arising as to the class within which
any goods fall or the definite area in respect of
which the geographical indication is to be
registered or where any goods are not specified
in the alphabetical index of goods published
shall be determined by the Registrar whose
decision in the matter shall be final.
Application for Registration
Under section 11 any association of persons or
producers or any organisation or authority
established by or under any law for the time
being in force representing the interest of the
producers of the concerned goods, who are

may prefer an appeal .

Duration of registration
Section 18 of the Act deals with duration,
renewal, removal and restoration of registration
of Geographical Indication. The registration of a
geographical indication shall be for a period of
ten years, but may be renewed from time to time
in accordance with the provisions of this section.

The registration of an authorised user shall be
for a period of ten years or for the period till the
date on which the registration of the
geographical indication in respect of which the
auhorised user is registered expires, whichever
is earlier.
The Registrar shall, on application made in the
prescribed manner, by the registered proprietor
or by the authorised user and within the
prescribed period and subject to the payment of
the prescribed fee, renew the registration of the
geographical indication or authorised user, as
the case may be, for a period of ten years from
the date of expiration of the original registration
or of the last renewal of registration, as the case
may be.
Infringement of Unregistered geographical
Indication
As per section 20 of the Act a person shall not
be entitled to institute any proceeding to prevent,
or to recover damages for, the infringement of
an unregistered geographical indication.
Infringement of Registered geographical
Indications
As per section 22 a registered geographical
indication is infringed by a person who, not being
an authorized user thereof uses such
geographical indication by any means in the
designations or presentation of goods that
indicates or suggests that such goods originate
in a geographical area other than the true place
of origin of such goods in a manner goods; or
which misleads the persons as to the
geographical origin of such goods; or uses any
geographical indication in such manner which
constitutes an act of unfair competition including
passing off in respect of registered geographical
indication.
It may be noted that "act of unfair competition''
means any act of competition contrary to honest
practices in industrial or commercial matters.
The following acts shall be deemed to be acts of
unfair competition, namely:
* all acts of such a nature as to create confusion
by any means whatsoever with the
establishment, the goods or the industrial or
commercial activities, of a competitor;
* false allegations in the course of trade of such
a nature as to discredit the establishment, the
goods or the industrial or commercial activities,
of a competitor;
* geographical indications, the use of which in
the course of trade is liable to mislead the
persons as to the nature, the manufacturing
process, the characteristics, the suitability for
their purpose, or the quantity, of the goods.
A registered geographical indication is infringed
by a person who, not being an authorised user
thereof uses another geographical indication to
the goods which, although literally true as to the
territory, region or locality in which the goods
originate, falsely represents to the persons that
the goods originate in the territory, region or
locality in respect of which such registered
geographical indication relates.
When is a registered Geographical Indication
said to be infringed?
* When an unauthorised user uses a
geographical indication that indicates or
suggests that such goods originate in a
geographical area other than the true place of
origin of such goods in a manner which mislead
the public as to the geographical origin of such
goods.
* When the use of geographical indication result
in an unfair competition including passing off in
respect of registered geographical indication.
* When the use of another geographical
indication results in false representation to the
public that goods originate in a territory in
respect of which a registered geographical
indication relates.

Assignment or Transmission
Section 24 of the Act prohibits assignment or
transmission of geographical indication. It states
that any right to a registered geographical
indication shall not be the subject matter of
assignment, transmission, licensing, pledge,
mortgage or any such other agreement.
However, on the death of an authorised user his
right in a registered geographical indication shall
devolve on his successor in title under the law
for the time being in force.
Prohibition of Registration of geographical
Indication as Trade mark
Section 25 of the Act provides that the Registrar
of Trade Marks shall, suo-motu or at the request
of an interested party, refuse or invalidate the
registration of a trade mark which contains or
consists of a geographical indication with respect
to the goods or class or classes of goods not
originating in the territory of a country, or a
region or locality in that territory which such
geographical indication indicates, if use of such
geographical indications in the trade mark for
such goods, is of such a nature as to confuse or
mislead the persons as to the true place of origin
of such goods or class or classes of goods.
How a Geographical Indication is different from a
Trade Mark?
> A trade mark is a sign which is used in the
course of trade and it distinguishes goods or
services of one enterprise from those of other
enterprises.
> Whereas a geographical indication is an
indication used to identify goods having special
characteristics originating from a definite
geographical territory.
In the case of Tea Board, India vs. ITC Limited
(GA No. 3137 of 2010 CS No. 250 of 2010),
Judgement dated 20 April, 2011 plaintiff moved
an interlocutory application for temporary
injunction for restraining the defendant from
using or conducting or making its business at the
hotel by the name "DARJEELING LOUNGE".
Application stated that usage of the word
"DARJEELING" in the name and logo by
defendants is passing off or attempting to pass
off its business or services so as to discredit the
fame of Darjeeling tea as a geographical
indication and/ or to mislead persons.
Hon'ble Calcutta High Court inter alia observed
that passing-off as in Section 20(2) of the GI Act
has to be seen in the light of what it implies in
trade mark law. As to whether any goods or
services are passed off as some other goods or
services would depend on a variety of factors
ranging from the nature of the marks, their
resemblance, the nature of the goods and
services, the similarity of the character of the
goods and services, the mode of accessing the
goods or services and other surrounding
circumstances.
The word "Darjeeling" - as precious to tea as it
may be as champagne to sparkling wines of that
province in France - cannot be exclusively
claimed by the plaintiff by virtue of its registration
as a geographical indication or as a certification
trade mark. Even for a case of passing-off, the
use of "Darjeeling" by a person other than the
plaintiff can be complained of if the word or the
geographical indication has any nexus with the
product with which it is exclusively associated
upon the registration. It is not necessary to
consider whether a "Darjeeling Tea Stall" selling
only hot cups of tea can entitle the plaintiff to
carry a complaint in respect thereof or a
"Darjeeling Tea House" selling all varieties of
packaged tea can be said to be in derogation of
the plaintiff's rights. The defendant's "Darjeeling
Lounge" is an exclusive area within the confines
of its hotel which is accessible only to its high-
end customers. The lounge is a place where
such customers and accompanying visitors may
frequent, and even sip Darjeeling tea or any
other beverage or drink, but there is scarcely any
likelihood of deception or confusion in the lounge
being named "Darjeeling" for the plaintiff to be
granted to any order that it seeks.
As to the case of dilution, the name "Darjeeling"
has been extensively used in trading and
commercial circles for decades before the GI Act
was enacted. In a case of dilution by blurring, it
is the uniqueness of a mark which is protected
even in a case where there is no likelihood of
confusion. But the word "Darjeeling" has been
and continues to be so widely used as a
business name or for like purpose for so long
that the plaintiff's recent registration would, prima
facie, not entitle it to enjoy the kind of exclusivity
that it asserts.
OFFENCES, PENALTIES AND PROCEDURE
Meaning of Applying geographical Indications
Section 37 of the Act provides that a person
shall be deemed to apply a geographical
indication to goods who:
(a) applies it to the goods themselves; or
(b) applies it to any package in or with which the
goods are sold, or exposed for sale, or had in
possession for sale or for any purpose of trade
or manufacture; or
(c) places, encloses or annexes any goods which
are sold, or exposed for sale, or had in
possession for sale or for any purpose of trade
or manufacture, in or with any package or other
thing to which a geographical indication has been
applied; or
(d) uses a geographical indication in any manner
reasonably likely to lead to the belief that the
goods in connection with which it is used are
designated or described by that geographical
indication; or
(e) in relation to the goods uses a geographical
indication in any sign, advertisement, invoice,
catalogue, business letter, business paper, price
list or other commercial documents and goods
are delivered to a person in pursuance of a
request or order made by reference to the
geographical indication as so used.
A geographical indication shall be deemed to be
applied to goods whether it is woven in,
impressed on, or otherwise worked into, or
annexed or affixed to, the goods or to any
package or other thing.
Falsifying and Falsely Applying geographical
Indications
Section 38 states that a person shall be deemed
to falsify a geographical indication who, either:
(a) without the assent of the authorised user of
the geographical indication makes that
geographical indication or deceptively similar
geographical indication; or
(b) falsifies any genuine geographical indication,
whether by alteration, addition, effacement or
otherwise.
A person shall be deemed to falsely apply to
goods a geographical indication who, without the
assent of the authorised user of the geographical
indication:
(a) applies such geographical indication or a
deceptively similar geographical indication to
goods or any package containing goods;
(b) uses any package bearing a geographical
indication which is identical with or deceptively
similar to the geographical indication of such
authorised user, for the purpose of packing,
filling or wrapping therein any goods other than
the genuine goods of the authorised user of the
geographical indication.
Any geographical indication falsified or falsely
applied referred to as a false geographical
indication.
In any prosecution for falsifying a geographical
indication or falsely applying a geographical
indication to goods, the burden of proving the
assent of proprietor shall lie on the accused.
Penalty for Applying False geographical
Indications
According to Section 39 of the Act, any person
who:
(a) falsifies any geographical indication; or
(b) falsely applies to goods any geographical
indication; or
(c) makes, disposes of, or has in his possession,
any die, block, machine, plate or other
instrument for the purpose of falsifying or of
being used for falsifying, a geographical
indication; or
(d) applies to any goods to which an indication of
the country or place in which they were made or
produced or the name and the address of the
manufacturer or person for whom the goods are
manufactured is required to be applied under
section 71, a false indication of such country,
place, name or address; or
(e) tampers with, alters or effaces an indication
of origin which has been applied to any goods to
which it is required to be applied under section
71; or
(f) causes any of the things above-mentioned in
this section to be done, shall, unless he proves
that he acted, without intent to defraud,
be punishable with imprisonment for a term
which shall not be less than six months but which
may extend to three years and with fine which
shall not be less than fifty thousand rupees but
which may extend to two lakh rupees.
It may be noted that the court may, for adequate
and special reasons to be mentioned in the
judgment, impose a sentence of imprisonment
for a term of less than six months or a fine of less
than fifty thousand rupees.
Special Provisions Relating to Applications for
Registration from Citizens of Convention
Countries
Section 84 empowers Central Government may
by notification in the Official Gazette, declare
such country or group of countries or union of
countries or Inter-Governmental Organisations to
be a convention country or convention countries
for the purposes of the Act for the fulfillment of a
treaty, convention or arrangement with any
country or a country which is a member of a
group of countries or union of countries or Inter-
Governmental Organisations outside India which
affords to citizens of India similar privileges as
granted to its own citizens.
LESSON ROUND-UP
* Geographical indication in relation to goods
means an indication which identifies such goods
as agricultural goods, natural goods or
manufactured goods as originating, or
manufactured in the territory of a country, or a
region or locality in that territory, where a given
quality, reputation or other characteristic of such
goods is essentially attributable to its
geographical origin and in case where such
goods are manufactured goods one of the
activities of either the production or of
processing or preparation of the goods
concerned takes place in such territory, region or
locality, as the case may be.
* Goods mean any agricultural, natural or
manufactured goods or any goods of handicraft
or of industry and includes food stuff.
* Indication includes any name, geographical or
figurative representation or any combination of
them conveying or suggesting the geographical
origin of goods to which it applies.
* The object of the Geographical Indications of
Goods (Registration and Protection) Act, 1999 is
three fold, firstly by specific law governing the
geographical indications of goods in the country
which could adequately protect the interest of
producers of such goods, secondly, to exclude
unauthorized persons from misusing
geographical indications and to protect
consumers from deception and thirdly, to
promote goods bearing Indian geographical
indications in the export market.
* Any association of persons or producers or any
organisation or authority established by or under
any law for the time being in force representing
the interest of the producers of the concerned
goods, who are desirous of registering a
geographical indication in relation to such goods
shall apply in writing to the Registrar in such
form and in such manner and accompanied by
such fees as may be prescribed for the
registration of the geographical indication.
* A trade mark is a sign which is used in the
course of trade and it distinguishes goods or
services of one enterprise from those of other
enterprises. Whereas a geographical indication
is an indication used to identify goods having
special characteristics originating from a definite
geographical territory.

REgULATORY FRAMEWORK
                                                                             Designs Rules,
                                                   ?   Designs Act, 2000 ?   2001
INTRODUCTION
Industrial designs refer to creative activity which
result in the ornamental or formal appearance of
a product and design right refers to a novel or
original design that is accorded to the proprietor
of a validly registered design. Industrial designs
are an element of intellectual property.
The first legislation in India for protection of
Industrial Designs was The Patents & Designs
Protection Act, 1872. It supplemented the 1859
Act passed by Governor General of India for
granting exclusive privileges to inventors and
added protection for Industrial Design. The 1872
Act included the term - any new and original
pattern or design, or the application of such
pattern or design to any substance or article of
manufacture'.
The Inventions & Designs Act of 1888 re-enacted
the law relating to protection of inventions and
designs and contained provision relating to
Designs in a separate part 3. The Patents &
Designs Act enacted in 1911 also provided for
protection of Industrial Designs. The Patents Act,
1970 repealed the provisions of the Patents and
Designs Act, 1911, so far as they related to
Patents. However, the provisions relating to
Designs were not repealed and continued to
govern the Designs Law.
India joined the WTO as a - member State in
1995. Consequently, the Patents & Designs Act,
1911 was repealed and the Designs Act, 2000
was enacted, to make the Designs Law in India
TRIPS compliant. Article 25 of the World Trade
Organization TRIPS Agreement, obliges
Members to provide for the protection of
independently created industrial designs that are
new or original. A design which is not new or
original; or which has been disclosed to the
public anywhere; or which is not significantly
distinguishable from known design or
combination of known design; or which
comprises or contains scandalous or obscene
matter are prohibited for registration under the
Design Act, 2000.
The objective of the Designs Act, 2000 is to
protect new or original designs so created to be
applied or applicable to particular article to be
manufactured by Industrial Process or means.
Sometimes purchase of articles for use is
influenced not only by their practical efficiency
but also by their appearance. The important
purpose of design registration is to see that the
artisan, creator, originator of a design having
aesthetic look is not deprived of his bonafide
reward by others applying it to their goods.
In the case of Bharat Glass Tube Limited vs.
Gopal Glass Works Limited, Appeal (Civil) 3185
of 2008 Judgement dated 1 May, 2008, Supreme
Court of India observed that:
It may be mentioned here that in 1911 the
Designs Act was passed by the then British
Government in India. But with the advancement
of science and technology and the number of
registration of the design having increased in
India, the Act of 1911 was amended wholesale
by the Parliament and this new Act known as
Designs Act, 2000 came to be introduced in the
Parliament and the same was passed as such.
The statement of objects and reasons read as
under:
Since the enactment of the Designs Act, 1911
considerable progress has been made in the
field of science and technology. The legal
system of the protection of industrial designs
requires to be made more efficient in order to
ensure effective protection to registered designs.
It is also required to promote design activity in
order to promote the design element in an article
of production. The proposed Design Bill is
essentially aimed to balance these interests. It is
also intended to ensure that the law does not
unnecessarily extent protection beyond what is
necessary to create the required incentive for
design activity while removing impediments to
the free use of available designs.
In fact, the sole purpose of this Act is protection
of the intellectual property right of the original
design for a period of ten years or whatever
further period extendable. The object behind this
enactment is to benefit the person for his
research and labour put in by him to evolve the
new and original design. This is the sole aim of
enacting this Act. It has also laid down that if
design is not new or original or published
previously then such design should not be
registered. It further lays down that if it has been
disclosed to the public anywhere in India or in
any other country by publication in tangible form
or by use or in any other way prior to the filing
date, or where applicable, the priority date of the
application for registration then such design will
not be registered or if it is found that it is not
significantly distinguishable from known designs
or combination of known designs, then such
designs shall not be registered. It also provides
that registration can be cancelled under section
19 of the Act if proper application is filed before
the competent authority i.e. the Controller that
the design has been previously registered in
India or published in India or in any other country
prior to the date of registration, or that the design
is not a new or original design or that the design
is not registerable under this Act or that it is not a
design as defined in clause (d) of section 2. The
Controller after hearing both the parties if
satisfied that the design is not new or original or
that it has already been registered or if it is not
registerable, cancel such registration and
aggrieved against that order, appeal shall lie to
the High Court. These prohibitions have been
engrafted so as to protect the original person
who has designed a new one by virtue of his
own efforts by researching for a long time. The
new and original design when registered is for a
period of ten years. Such original design which is
new and which has not been available in the
country or has not been previously registered or
has not been published in India or in any other
country prior to the date of registration shall be
protected for a period of ten years. Therefore, it
is in the nature of protection of the intellectual
property right. This was the purpose as is evident
from the statement of objects and reasons and
from various provisions of the Act......
In the case of Escorts construction Equipment
Ltd. vs. Action construction Equipment Pvt. Ltd
1999 PTC 36(Del) at pp 39, 40, 48], Delhi High
Court observed that the primary object the Act is
to protect shape and not the function or
functional shape. The expression design doesn't
include a method or principle of construction or
features of shape or configuration which is
dictated solely by the function which the article to
be made in that shape or configuration has to
perform.
DESIgN
As per section 2(d) Design means only the
features of shape, configuration, pattern or
ornament or composition of lines or colour or
combination thereof applied to any article
whether two dimensional or three dimensional or
in both forms, by any industrial process or
means, whether manual, mechanical or
chemical, separate or combined, which in the
finished article appeal to and are judged solely
by the eye, but does not include any mode or
principle or construction or anything which is in
substance a mere mechanical device, and does
not include any trade mark, as define in clause
(v) of sub-section of Section 2 of the Trade and
Merchandise Marks Act, 1958, property mark or
artistic works as defined under Section 2(c) of
the Copyright Act, 1957.
An artistic work as defined under Section 2(c) of
the Copyright Act, 1957 is not a subject matter
for registration which reads as follows:

Article means any article of manufacture and any
substance, artificial, or partly artificial and partly
natural; and includes any part of an article
capable of being made and sold separately.
Design is one of the categories of IPR where the
design system focuses on the aesthetic feature
of an article derived from its visual appearance.
Relevant aspects are the shape, configuration,
surface pattern, the colour or line or a
combination thereof as applied to an article
which produces an aesthetic impression on the
sense of sight. Following are the pictorial
examples of design:

(ii) Where any person acquires the design or the
right to apply the design to any article, either
exclusively of any other person or otherwise,
means, in the respect and to the extent in and to
which the design or right has been so acquired,
the person by whom the design or right is so

(iii) In any other case, means the author of the

apply, the design has devolved from the original
proprietor upon any other person, includes that
other person.
[Section 2(j)]
Prohibition of Registration of Certain Designs
A design which prohibited of registration under
Section 4 of the Design Act, 2000 are as follows:
* is not new or original; or
* has been disclosed to the public anywhere in
India or in any other country by publication in
tangible form or by use or in any other way prior
to the filing date, or where applicable, the priority
date of the application for registration; or
                                                                          comprises or
                                                                          contains
                                                                          scandalous or
                                                                          obscene matter,
* is not significantly distinguishable from known                         shall not be
designs or combination of known designs; or        ?                      registered.
Hon'ble Supreme Court of India held that
expression new or original appearing in Section
4 means that the design which has been
registered has not been published anywhere or it
has been made known to the public and that it
had been invented for the first time or it has not
been reproduced by anyone.
In the matter of M/s Brighto Auto Industries vs.
Shri Raj Chawla (ILR 1978 (I) Delhi) it was held
by the Honorable Court that new is taken
generally to mean as different to what has gone
before and original as something originating from
the author. In the matter of novelty the eye has
to be the ultimate arbiter and the determination
has to rest on the general ocular impression. To
secure recognition for its newness or originality it
is imperative that a design identical with or even
materially similar to the relevant design should
not have been published or registered
previously. A slight trivial or infinitesimal variation
from a preexisting design will not qualify it for
registration taking into account the nature
involved the change introduced should be
substantial. It is not necessary to justify
registration that the whole of the design should
be new, the newness may be confined to only a
part of it but that part must be a significant one
and it should be potent enough to impart to the
whole design a distinct identity, unless the
registration sought for the said part alone.
Further it was held that it is the duty of the court
to take special care that no design shall be
counted new or original, unless it is distinct from
what previously existed by something essentially
new or original which is different from ordinary
trade variants, which may have lost, been
common matters of test or choice in that trade.
Application for Registration of Designs (Section
5)
(1) The Controller may, on the application of any
person claiming to be the proprietor of any new
or original design not previously published in any
country and which is not contrary to public order
or morality, register the design under this Act.
(2) Every application shall be in the prescribed
form and shall be filed in the patent office in the
prescribed manner and shall be accompanied by
the prescribed fee.
(3) A design may be registered in not more than
one class, and, in case of doubt as to the class
in which a design ought to be registered, the
Controller may decide the question.
(4) The Controller may, if he thinks fit, refuse to
register any design presented to him for
registration; but any person aggrieved by any
such refusal may appeal to the High Court.
(5) An application which, owing to any default or
neglect on the part of the applicant, has not been
completed so as to enable registration to be
effected within the prescribed time shall be
deemed to be abandoned.
(6) A design when registered shall be registered
as of the date of the application for registration.

registration.pdf
Registration to be in respect of Particular Article
(Section 6)
(1) A design may be registered in respect of any
or all of the articles comprised in a prescribed
class of articles.
(2) Any question arising as to the class within
which any article falls shall be determined by the
Controller whose decision in the matter shall be
final.
(3) Where a design has been registered in
respect of any article comprised in a class of
article, the application of the proprietor of the
design to register it in respect of some one or
more other articles comprised in that class of
articles shall not be refused, nor shall the
registration thereof invalidated -
(a) on the ground of the design not being a new
or original design, by reason only that it was so
previously registered; or
(b) on the ground of the design having been
previously published in India or in any other
country, by reason only that it has been applied
to article in respect of which it was previously
registered.
It may be noted that such subsequent
registration shall not extend the period of
copyright in the design beyond that arising from
previous registration.
(4) Where any person makes an application for
the registration of a design in respect of any
article and either-
(a) that design has been previously registered by
another person in respect of some other article;
or
(b) the design to which the application relates
consists of a design previously registered by
another person in respect of the same or some
other article with modifications or variations not
sufficient to alter the character or substantially to
affect the identity thereof, then, if at any time
while the application is pending the applicant
becomes the registered proprietor of the design
previously registered, the foregoing provisions of
this section shall apply as if at the time of making
the application, the applicant, had been the
registered proprietor of that design.
Essential requirements for the registration of
'Design' under the Act
> The design should be new or original, not
previously published or used in any country
before the date of application for registration.
The novelty may reside in the application of a
known shape or pattern to new subject matter.
> The design should relate to features of shape,
configuration, pattern or ornamentation applied
or applicable to an article.
> The design should be applied or applicable to
any article by any industrial process.
> The features of the design in the finished
article should appeal to and are judged solely by
the eye. This implies that the design must
appear and should be visible on the finished
article, for which it is meant.
> Any mode or principle of construction or
operation or anything which is in substance a
mere mechanical device, would not be a
registrable design. For instance a key having its
novelty only in the shape of its corrugation or
bent at the portion intended to engage with
levers inside the lock associated with, cannot be
registered as a design under the Act.
> The design should not include any Trade Mark
or property mark or artistic works as defined
under the Copyright Act, 1957.
Publication of Particulars of Registered Designs
Section 7 of the Act provides that the Controller
shall, as soon as may be after the registration of
a design, cause publication of the prescribed
particulars of the design to be published in such
manner as may be prescribed and thereafter the
design shall be open to public inspection.
Substitution of Applicant or Joint Claiming
(Section 8)
(a) Name of an applicant can be substituted or a
joint claim can be made for an applied design, if
the following requirements are met:
i. The claim for substitution is made before the
design has been registered; and
ii. Right of claimant shall be created only by:
> An assignment;
> Agreement in writing made by the applicant or
one of the applicants; or
> Operation of law;
iii. The design under consideration shall be
identified in the assignment or agreement
specifically by reference to the number of
application for registration; or
iv. The rights of the claimant in respect of the
design have been finally established by a Court.
(b) A request for substitution of applicant shall be
filed in Form-2 along with the required fee. If the
above said requirements are fulfilled and the
Controller is satisfied that, upon registration of
design, the claimant would be entitled to any
interest in the design the Controller may direct
that the application shall proceed:
i. in the names of the claimant(s); or
ii. in the names of the claimant(s) and the
applicant or the other joint applicant(s), as the
case may be.
(c) However, in case of joint applicants, the
Controller shall not pass such direction without
with the consent of the other joint applicant(s);
(d) In case, joint applicant(s) die(s) at any time
before the design has been registered, a request
may be made for substitution by the survivor(s)
and the Controller may direct that the application
shall proceed in the name of the survivors alone.
However, no such direction shall be issued
without the consent of legal representative of the
deceased;
(e) If case, there is any dispute between joint
applicants as to whether or in what manner the
application should be proceeded with an
application may be made by any of the parties.
The Controller may give such directions as he
thinks fit for enabling the application to proceed
in the name of one or more of the parties alone
or for regulating the manner in which it should be
proceeded with, or for both those purposes, as
the case may be. However, the Controller shall
not pass any such direction without giving an
opportunity to be heard to all the concerned
parties.
Certificate of Registration.
Under section 9 of the Design Act, the Controller
grant a certificate of registration to the proprietor
of the design when it registered.
The Controller may, in case of loss of the
original certificate, or in any other case in which
he deems it expedient, furnish one or more
copies of the certificate.
Effect of Registration of Design
The registration of a design confers upon the
registered proprietor 'Copyright' in the design for
the period of registration. 'Copyright' means the
exclusive right to apply a design to the article
belonging to the class in which it is registered.
Register of Designs
Section 10 of the Act provides that there shall be
kept at the patent office a book called the
register of designs, wherein shall be entered the
names and addresses of proprietors of
registered designs, notifications of assignments
and of transmissions of registered designs, and
such other matter as may be prescribed and
such register may be maintained wholly or partly
on computer, floppies or diskettes, subject to
such safeguards as may be prescribed.
The register of designs shall be prima facie
evidence of any matter by this Act directed or
authorized to be entered therein.
Copyright on Registration
Section 11 provides that when a design is
registered, the registered proprietor of the design
shall, subject to the provisions of this Act, have
copyright in the design during ten years from the
date of registration. However, before the
expiration of the said ten years, application for
the extension of the period of copyright is made
to the Controller in the prescribed manner, the
Controller shall, on payment of the prescribed
fee, extend the period of copyright for a second
period of five years from the expiration of the
original period of ten years.
High Court of Delhi in the case of Microfibers
Inc. vs. Girdhar and Co. and Anr. had inter alia
criteria observed the following guidelines:
a. The definition of artistic work has a very wide
connotation as it is not circumscribed by any
limitation of the work possessing any artistic
quality. Even an abstract work, such as a few
lines or curves arbitrarily drawn would qualify as
an artistic work. It may be two dimensional or
three dimensional. The artistic work may or may
not have visual appeal.
b. The rights to which a holder of an original
artistic work is entitled are enumerated in
Section 14(c) of the Copyright Act.
c. It is the exclusive right of the holder of a
Copyright in an original artistic work to reproduce
the work in any material form. For example, a
drawing of an imaginary futuristic automobile,
which is an original artistic work, may be
reproduced in the three-dimensional material
from using an element, such as a metal sheet.
d. The design protection in case of registered
works under the Designs Act cannot be
extended to include the copyright protection to
the works which were industrially produced.
e. A perusal of the Copyright Act and the
Designs Act and indeed the Preamble and the
Statement of Objects and Reasons of the
Designs Act makes it clear that the legislative
intent was to grant a higher protection to pure
original artistic works such as paintings,
sculptures etc and lesser protection to design
activity which is commercial in nature. The
legislative intent is, thus, clear that the protection
accorded to a work which is commercial in
nature is lesser than and not to be equated with
the protection granted to a work of pure Article.

f. The original paintings/artistic works which may
be used to industrially produce the designed
article would continue to fall within the meaning
of the artistic work defined under Section 2(c) of
the Copyright Act, 1957 and would be entitled to
the full period of copyright protection as evident
from the definition of the design under Section
2(d) of the Designs Act. However, the intention
of producing the artistic work is not relevant.
g. This is precisely why the legislature not only
limited the protection by mandating that the
copyright shall cease under the Copyright Act in
a registered design but in addition, also deprived
copyright protection to designs capable of being
registered under the Designs Act, but not so
registered, as soon as the concerned design had
been applied more than 50 times by industrial
process by the owner of the copyright or his
licensee.
h. In the original work of art, copyright would
exist and the author/holder would continue
enjoying the longer protection granted under the
Copyright Act in respect of the original artistic
work per se.
i. If the design is registered under the Designs
Act, the design would lose its copyright
protection under the Copyright Act. If it is a
design registrable under the Designs Act but has
not so been registered, the design would
continue to enjoy copyright protection under the
Act so long as the threshold limit of its
application on an article by an industrial process
for more than 50 times is reached. But once that
limit is crossed, it would lose its copyright
protection under the Copyright Act. This
interpretation would harmonize the Copyright
and the Designs Act in accordance with the
legislative intent.
What is the duration of the registration of a
design? Can it be extended?
The duration of the registration of a design is
initially ten years from the date of registration,
but in cases where claim to priority has been
allowed the duration is ten years from the priority
date. This initial period of registration may be
extended by further period of 5 years on an
application made to the Controller before the
expiry of the said initial period of ten years.
Restoration of Lapsed Designs
Section 12 of the Act provides that where a
design has ceased to have effect by reason of
failure to pay the fee for the extension of
copyright, the proprietor of such design or his
legal representative and where the design was
held by two or more persons jointly, then, with
the leave of the Controller one or more of them
without joining the others, may, within one year
from the date on which the design ceased to
have effect, make an application for the
restoration of the design in the prescribed
manner on payment of such fee as may be
prescribed.
An application under this section shall contain a
statement, verified in the prescribed manner,
fully setting out the circumstances which led to
the failure to pay the prescribed fee, and the
Controller may require from the applicant such
further evidence as he may think necessary.
Can the Registration of a Design be cancelled?
                                                    ? That the
According to Section 19 of the Act, the             design has

Designs to bind government
As per Section 20 a registered design shall have
to all intents the like effect as against the
Government as it has against any person and
the provisions of Chapter XVII of the Patents
Act, 1970 shall apply to registered designs as
they apply to patents.
Piracy of Registered Design
During the existence of copyright in any design it
shall not be lawful for any person, without the
license or written consent of the registered
proprietor:
i. for the purpose of sale to apply or cause to be
applied, to any article in any class of articles in
which the design is registered, the design or any
fraudulent or obvious imitation thereof, or to do
anything with a view to enable the design to be
so applied;
                                                     iii. to publish
                                                     or expose or
                                                     cause to be
                                                     published or
                                                     exposed for
                                                     sale, that
ii. to import such article for the purposes of sale; article.
What is Piracy of a Design?
Piracy of a design means the application of a
design or its imitation to any article belonging to
class of articles in which the design has been
registered for the purpose of sale or importation
of such articles without the written consent of the
registered proprietor. Publishing such articles or
exposing terms for sale with knowledge of the
unauthorized application of the design to them
also involves piracy of the design.
Industrial and International Exhibitions
The exhibition of a design, or of any article to
which a design is applied, at an industrial or
other exhibition to which the provisions of this
section have been extended by the Central
Government by notification in the Official
Gazette, or the publication of a description of the
design, during or after the period of the holding
of the exhibition, or the exhibition of the design or
the article or the publication of a description of
the design by any person else-where during or
after the period of the holding of the exhibition,
without the privity or consent of the proprietor,
shall not prevent the design from being
registered or invalidate the registration thereof.
It may be noted that-
(a) the exhibitor exhibiting the design or article,
or publishing a description of the design, gives to
the Controller previous notice in the prescribed
form; and
(b) the application for registration is made within
six months from the date of first exhibiting the
design or article or publishing a description of the
design.

1. Choose the correct answer(s) and justify the
same:
i. Mr. " X" purchased a tractor from ABC Ltd. for
tilling the land but he used it in idle time for
transportation of agricultural produce on hire.
Some defects were developed in the engine of
the tractor. He complained to ABC Ltd., but all in
vain. Then he filed a suit in Consumer Disputes
Redressal Forum for damages caused by the
defects. ABC Ltd. pleaded that Mr. X is not a
'consumer' within the definition of section 2(7) of
the Consumer Protection Act, 2019, as he is
using the tractor for commercial purposes.
Whether Mr. X will used the tractor for
commercial purpose?

commercial purposes.

(b) Commercial Purpose does not include use by
a person of goods bought and used by him
exclusively for the purpose of earning his
livelihood, by means of self-employment; the
expressions "buys any goods" and "hires or
avails any services" includes offline or online
transactions through electronic means or by
teleshopping or direct selling or multi-level
marketing. Usage by Mr. X does not fall under
the preview of commercial purpose.
(c) Any person who hires or avails of any service
for a consideration which has been paid or
promised or partly paid and partly promised, or
under any system of deferred payment.
(d) The first half will be treated as personal use
